<h2>PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In preparing</span> this new edition of “Sound,” I have
carefully gone over the last one; amended, as far as possible,
its defects of style and matter, and paid at the
same time respectful attention to the criticisms and suggestions
which the former editions called forth.</p>

<p>The cases are few in which I have been content to
reproduce what I have <em>read</em> of the works of acousticians.
I have sought to make myself experimentally familiar
with the ground occupied; trying, in all cases, to present
the illustrations in the form and connection most
suitable for educational purposes.</p>

<p>Though bearing, it may be, an undue share of the imperfection
which cleaves to all human effort, the work
has already found its way into the literature of various
nations of diverse intellectual standing. Last year, for
example, a new German edition was published “under the
special supervision” of Helmholtz and Wiedemann. That
men so eminent, and so overladen with official duties,
should add to these the labor of examining and correcting
every proof-sheet of a work like this, shows that
they consider it to be what it was meant to be—a serious
attempt to improve the public knowledge of science. It
is especially gratifying to me to be thus assured that not
in England alone has the book met a public want, but
also in that learned land to which I owe my scientific
education.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span></p>

<p>Before me, on the other hand, lie two volumes of
foolscap size, curiously stitched, and printed in characters
the meaning of which I am incompetent to penetrate.
Here and there, however, I notice the familiar figures of
the former editions of “Sound.” For these volumes I
am indebted to Mr. John Fryer, of Shanghai, who, along
with them, favored me, a few weeks ago, with a letter
from which the following is an extract: “One day,”
writes Mr. Fryer, “soon after the first copy of your work
on Sound reached Shanghai, I was reading it in my
study, when an intelligent official, named Hsii-chung-hu,
noticed some of the engravings and asked me to explain
them to him. He became so deeply interested in the
subject of Acoustics that nothing would satisfy him but
to make a translation. Since, however, engineering and
other works were then considered to be of more practical
importance by the higher authorities, we agreed to translate
your work during our leisure time every evening,
and publish it separately ourselves. Our translation,
however, when completed, and shown to the higher officials,
so much interested them, and pleased them, that
they at once ordered it to be published at the expense of
the Government, and sold at cost price. The price is
four hundred and eighty copper cash per copy, or about
one shilling and eightpence. This will give you an idea
of the cheapness of native printing.”</p>

<p>Mr. Fryer adds that his Chinese friend had no difficulty
in grasping every idea in the book.</p>


<p class="tb">The new matter of greatest importance which has been
introduced into this edition is an account of an investigation
which, during the past two years, I have had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
honor of conducting in connection with the Elder Brethren
of the Trinity House. Under the title “Researches
on the Acoustic Transparency of the Atmosphere, in Relation
to the Question of Fog-signalling,” the subject is
treated in Chapter VII. of this volume. It was only by
Governmental appliances that such an investigation could
have been made; and it gives me pleasure to believe that
not only have the practical objects of the inquiry been
secured, but that a crowd of scientific errors, which for
more than a century and a half have surrounded this
subject, have been removed, their place being now taken
by the sure and certain truth of Nature. In drawing up
the account of this laborious inquiry, I aimed at linking
the observations so together that they alone should offer
a substantial demonstration of the principles involved.
Further labors enabled me to bring the whole inquiry
within the firm grasp of <em>experiment</em>; and thus to give it
a certainty which, without this final guarantee, it could
scarcely have enjoyed.</p>

<p>Immediately after the publication of the first brief abstract
of the investigation, it was subjected to criticism.
To this I did not deem it necessary to reply, believing
that the grounds of it would disappear in presence of the
full account. The only opinion to which I thought it
right to defer was to some extent a private one, communicated
to me by Prof. Stokes. He considered that I
had, in some cases, ascribed too exclusive an influence to
the mixed currents of aqueous vapor and air, to the neglect
of differences of temperature. That differences of
temperature, when they come into play, are an efficient
cause of acoustic opacity, I never doubted. In fact, aërial
reflection arising from this cause is, in the present in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>quiry,
for the first time made the subject of experimental
demonstration. What the relative potency of differences
of temperature and differences due to aqueous vapor, in
the cases under consideration, may be, I do not venture
to state; but as both are active, I have, in Chapter VII.,
referred to them jointly as concerned in the production
of those “acoustic clouds” to which the stoppage of
sound in the atmosphere is for the most part due.</p>



<p class="tb">Subsequently, however, to the publication of the full
investigation another criticism appeared, to which, in consideration
of its source, I would willingly pay all respect
and attention. In this criticism, which reached me first
through the columns of an American newspaper, differences
in the amounts of aqueous vapor, and differences
of temperature, are alike denied efficiency as causes of
acoustic opacity. At a meeting of the Philosophical Society
of Washington the emphatic opinion had, it was
stated, been expressed that I was wrong in ascribing the
opacity of the atmosphere to its flocculence, the really
efficient cause being <em>refraction</em>. This view appeared to
me so obviously mistaken that I assumed, for a time,
the incorrectness of the newspaper account.</p>

<p>Recently, however, I have been favored with the “Report
of the United States Lighthouse Board for 1874,”
in which the account just referred to is corroborated. A
brief reference to the Report will here suffice. Major
Elliott, the accomplished officer and gentleman referred
to at page 261, had published a record of his visit of
inspection to this country, in which he spoke, with a
perfectly enlightened appreciation of the facts, of the differences
between our system of lighthouse illumination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
and that of the United States. He also embodied in his
Report some account of the investigation on fog-signals,
the initiation of which he had witnessed, and indeed
aided, at the South Foreland.</p>

<p>On this able Report of their own officer the Lighthouse
Board at Washington make the following remark:
“Although this account is interesting in itself and to the
public generally, yet, being addressed to the Lighthouse
Board of the United States, it would tend to convey the
idea that the facts which it states were new to the Board,
and that the latter had obtained no results of a similar
kind; while a reference to the appendix to this Report<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
will show that the researches of our Lighthouse Board
have been much more extensive on this subject than
those of the Trinity House, and that the latter has established
no facts of practical importance which had not
been previously observed and used by the former.”</p>

<p>The “appendix” here referred to is from the pen of
the venerable Prof. Joseph Henry, chairman of the Lighthouse
Board at Washington. To his credit be it recorded
that at a very early period in the history of fog-signalling
Prof. Henry reported in favor of Daboll’s trumpet, though
he was opposed by one of his colleagues on the ground
that “fog-signals were of little importance, since the mariner
should know his place by the character of his soundings.”
In the appendix, he records the various efforts
made in the United States with a view to the establishment
of fog-signals. He describes experiments on bells,
and on the employment of reflectors to reinforce their
sound. These, though effectual close at hand, were found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>to be of no use at a distance. He corrects current errors
regarding steam-whistles, which by some inventors were
thought to act like ringing bells. He cites the opinion
of the Rev. Peter Ferguson, that sound is better heard in
fog than in clear air. This opinion is founded on observations
of the noise of locomotives; in reference to which
it may be said that others have drawn from similar experiments
diametrically opposite conclusions. On the authority
of Captain Keeney he cites an occurrence, “in the
first part of which the captain was led to suppose that
fog had a marked influence in deadening sound, though
in a subsequent part he came to an opposite conclusion.”
Prof. Henry also describes an experiment made during a
fog at Washington, in which he employed “a small bell
rung by clock-work, the apparatus being the part of a
moderator lamp, intended to give warning to the keepers
when the supply of oil ceased. The result of the experiment
was, he affirms, contrary to the supposition of absorption
of the sound by the fog.” This conclusion is
not founded on comparative experiments, but on observations
made in the fog alone; for, adds Prof. Henry, “the
change in the condition of the atmosphere, as to temperature
and the motion of the air, before the experiment
could be repeated in clear weather, rendered the result
not entirely satisfactory.”</p>

<p>This, I may say, is the only experiment on fog which
I have found recorded in the appendix.</p>

<p>In 1867 the steam-siren was mounted at Sandy Hook,
and examined by Prof. Henry. He compared its action
with that of a Daboll trumpet, employing for this purpose
a stretched membrane covered with sand, and placed
at the small end of a tapering tube which concentrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
the sonorous motion upon the membrane. The siren
proved most powerful. “At a distance of 50, the
trumpet produced a decided motion of the sand, while
the siren gave a similar result at a distance of 58.”
Prof. Henry also varied the pitch of the siren, and found
that in association with its trumpet 400 impulses per second
yielded the maximum sound; while the best result
with the unaided siren was obtained when the impulses
were 360 a second. Experiments were also made on the
influence of pressure; from which it appeared that when
the pressure varied from 100 lbs. to 20 lbs., the distance
reached by the sound (as determined by the vibrating
membrane) varied only in the ratio of 61 to 51. Prof.
Henry also showed the sound of the fog-trumpet to be
independent of the material employed in its construction;
and he furthermore observed the decay of the sound
when the angular distance from the axis of the instrument
was increased. Further observations were made by Prof.
Henry and his colleagues in August, 1873, and in August,
and September, 1874. In the brief but interesting account
of these experiments a hypothetical element appears, which
is absent from the record of the earlier observations.</p>

<p>It is quite evident from the foregoing that, in regard
to the question of fog-signalling, the Lighthouse Board of
Washington have not been idle. Add to this the fact
that their eminent chairman gives his services gratuitously,
conducting without fee or reward experiments and
observations of the character here revealed, and I think
it will be conceded that he not only deserves well of his
own country, but also sets his younger scientific contemporaries,
both in his country and ours, an example of
high-minded devotion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span></p>

<p>I was quite aware, in a general way, that labors like
those now for the first time made public had been conducted
in the United States, and this knowledge was not
without influence upon my conduct. The first instruments
mounted at the South Foreland were of English
manufacture; and I, on various accounts, entertained a
strong sympathy for their able constructor, Mr. Holmes.
From the outset, however, I resolved to suppress such
feelings, as well as all other extraneous considerations,
individual or national; and to aim at obtaining the best
instruments, irrespective of the country which produced
them. In reporting, accordingly, on the observations of
May 19 and 20, 1873 (our first two days at the South
Foreland), these were my words to the Elder Brethren
of the Trinity House:</p>

<p>“In view of the reported performance of horns and
whistles in other places, the question arises whether those
mounted at the South Foreland, and to which the foregoing
remarks refer, are of the best possible description....
I think our first duty is to make ourselves
acquainted with the best instruments hitherto made, no
matter where made; and then, if home genius can transcend
them, to give it all encouragement. Great and
unnecessary expense may be incurred, through our not
availing ourselves of the results of existing experience.</p>

<p>“I have always sympathized, and I shall always sympathize,
with the desire of the Elder Brethren to encourage
the inventor who first made the magneto-electric light
available for lighthouse purposes. I regard his aid and
counsel as, in many respects, invaluable to the corporation.
But, however original he may be, our duty is to
demand that his genius shall be expended in making ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>vances
on that which has been already achieved elsewhere.
If the whistles and horns that we heard on the
19th and 20th be the very best hitherto constructed, my
views have been already complied with; but if they be
not—and I am strongly inclined to think that they are
not—then I would submit that it behooves us to have
the best, and to aim at making the South Foreland, both
as regards light and sound, a station not excelled by any
other in the world.”</p>

<p>On this score it gives me pleasure to say that I never
had a difficulty with the Elder Brethren. They agreed
with me; and two powerful steam-whistles, the one from
Canada, the other from the United States, together with
a steam-siren—also an American instrument—were in due
time mounted at the South Foreland. It will be seen in
Chapter VII. that my strongest recommendation applies
to an instrument for which we are indebted to the United
States.</p>

<p>In presence of these facts, it will hardly be assumed
that I wish to withhold from the Lighthouse Board of
Washington any credit that they may fairly claim. My
desire is to be strictly just; and this desire compels me
to express the opinion that their Report fails to establish
the inordinate claim made in its first paragraph. It contains
observations, but contradictory observations; while
as regards the establishment of any principle which
should reconcile the conflicting results, it leaves our
condition unimproved.</p>

<p>But I willingly turn aside from the discussion of
“claims” to the discussion of science. Inserted, as a
kind of intrusive element, into the Report of Prof.
Henry, is a second Report by General Duane, founded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
on an extensive series of observations made by him in
1870 and 1871. After stating with distinctness the points
requiring decision, the General makes the following
remarks:</p>

<p>“Before giving the results of these experiments, some
facts will be stated which will explain the difficulties of
determining the power of a fog-signal.</p>

<p>“There are six steam fog-whistles on the coast of
Maine: these have been frequently heard at a distance
of twenty miles, and as frequently cannot be heard at
the distance of two miles, and this with no perceptible
difference in the state of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>“The signal is often heard at a great distance in one
direction, while in another it will be scarcely audible at
the distance of a mile. This is not the effect of wind,
as the signal is frequently heard much further against
the wind than with it.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> For example, the whistle on Cape
Elizabeth can always be distinctly heard in Portland, a
distance of nine miles, during a heavy northeast snowstorm,
the wind blowing a gale directly from Portland
toward the whistle.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>“The most perplexing difficulties, however, arise from
the fact that the signal often appears to be surrounded by
a belt, varying in radius from one mile to one mile and a
half, from which the sound appears to be entirely absent.
Thus, in moving directly from a station the sound
is audible for the distance of a mile, is then lost for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>about the same distance, after which it is again distinctly
heard for a long time. This action is common to all ear-signals,
and has been at times observed at all the stations,
at one of which the signal is situated on a bare
rock twenty miles from the mainland, with no surrounding
objects to affect the sound.”</p>

<p>It is not necessary to assume here the existence of a
“belt,” at some distance from the station. The passage
of an acoustic cloud over the station itself would produce
the observed phenomenon.</p>

<p>Passing over the record of many other valuable observations
in the Report of General Duane, I come to a few
very important remarks which have a direct bearing upon
the present question:</p>

<p>“From an attentive observation,” writes the General,
“during three years, of the fog-signals on this coast, and
from the reports received from the captains and pilots of
coasting vessels, I am convinced that, in some conditions
of the atmosphere, the most powerful signals will be at
times unreliable.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>“Now it frequently occurs that a signal which, under
ordinary circumstances, would be audible at the distance
of fifteen miles, cannot be heard from a vessel at the distance
of a single mile. This is probably due to the
reflection mentioned by Humboldt.</p>

<p>“The temperature of the air over the land where the
fog-signal is located being very different from that over
the sea, the sound, in passing from the former to the latter,
undergoes reflection at their surface of contact. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>correctness of this view is rendered more probable by the
fact that, when the sound is thus impeded in the direction
of the sea, it has been observed to be much stronger
inland.</p>

<p>“Experiments and observation lead to the conclusion
that these anomalies in the penetration and direction of
sound from fog-signals are to be attributed mainly to the
want of uniformity in the surrounding atmosphere, and
that snow, rain, and fog, and the direction of the wind,
have much less influence than has been generally supposed.”</p>

<p>The Report of General Duane is marked throughout
by fidelity to facts, rare sagacity, and soberness of speculation.
The last three of the paragraphs just quoted
exhibit, in my opinion, the only approach to a true
explanation of the phenomena which the Washington
Report reveals. At this point, however, the eminent
Chairman of the Lighthouse Board strikes in with the
following criticism:</p>

<p>“In the foregoing I differ entirely in opinion from
General Duane as to the cause of extinction of powerful
sounds being due to the unequal density of the atmosphere.
The velocity of sound is not at all affected by
barometric pressure; but if the difference in pressure is
caused by a difference in heat, or by the expansive
power of vapor mingled with the air, a slight degree
of obstruction of sound may be observed. But this effect
we think is entirely too minute to produce the results
noted by General Duane and Dr. Tyndall, while we
shall find in the action of currents above and below a
true and efficient cause.”</p>

<p>I have already cited the remarkable observation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
General Duane, that with a snowstorm from the northeast
blowing against the sound, the signal at Cape Elizabeth
is always heard at Portland, a distance of nine
miles. The observations at the South Foreland, where
the sound has-been proved to reach a distance of more
than twelve miles against the wind, backed by decisive
experiments, reduce to certainty the surmises of General
Duane. It has, for example, been proved that a couple
of gas-flames placed in a chamber can, in a minute or
two, render its air so non-homogeneous as to cut a sound
practically off; while the same sound passes without sensible
impediment through showers of paper-scraps, seeds,
bran, raindrops, and through fumes and fogs of the
densest description. The sound also passes through thick
layers of calico, silk, serge, flannel, baize, close felt, and
through pads of cotton-net impervious to the strongest
light.</p>

<p>As long, indeed, as the air on which snow, hail, rain
or fog is suspended is homogeneous, so long will sound
pass through the air, sensibly heedless of the suspended
matter.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> This point is illustrated upon a large scale by
my own observations on the Mer de Glace, and by those
of General Duane, at Portland, which prove the snow-laden
air from the northeast to be a highly homogeneous
medium. Prof. Henry thus accounts for the fact that the
northeast snow-wind renders the sound of Cape Elizabeth
audible at Portland: In the higher regions of the atmosphere
he places an ideal wind, blowing in a direction opposed
to the real one, which <em>always</em> accompanies the
latter, and which more than neutralizes its action. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>speculating thus he bases himself on the reasoning of
Prof. Stokes, according to which a sound-wave moving
against the wind is tilted upward. The upper, and opposing
wind, is invented for the purpose of tilting again
the already lifted sound-wave downward. Prof. Henry
does not explain how the sound-wave recrosses the hostile
lower current, nor does he give any definite notion
of the conditions under which it can be shown that it
will reach the observer.</p>

<p>This, so far as I know, is the only theoretic gleam
cast by the Washington Report on the conflicting results
which have hitherto rendered experiments on fog-signals
so bewildering. I fear it is an <em>ignis fatuus</em>, instead of a
safe guiding light. Prof. Henry, however, boldly applies
the hypothesis in a variety of instances. But he dwells
with particular emphasis upon a case of non-reciprocity
which he considers absolutely fatal to my views regarding
the flocculence of the atmosphere. The observation
was made on board the steamer “City of Richmond,”
during a thick fog in a night of 1872. “The vessel was
approaching Whitehead from the southwestward, when,
at a distance of about six miles from the station, the fog-signal,
which is a 10-inch steam-whistle, was distinctly
perceived, and continued to be heard with increasing intensity
of sound until within about three miles, when the
sound suddenly ceased to be heard, and was not perceived
again until the vessel approached within a quarter
of a mile of the station, although from conclusive evidence,
furnished by the keeper, it was shown that the
signal had been sounding during the whole time.”</p>

<p>But while the 10-inch shore-signal thus failed to make
itself heard at sea, a 6-inch whistle on board the steamer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
made itself heard on shore. Prof. Henry thus turns this
fact against me. “It is evident,” he writes, “that this
result could not be due to any mottled condition or want
of acoustic transparency in the atmosphere, since this
would absorb the sound equally in both directions.”
Had the observation been made in a still atmosphere,
this argument would, at one time, have had great force.
But the atmosphere was not still, and a sufficient reason
for the observed non-reciprocity is to be found in the recorded
fact that the wind was blowing against the shore-signal,
and in favor of the ship-signal.</p>

<p>But the argument of Prof. Henry, on which he places
his main reliance, would be untenable, even had the air
been still. By the very aërial reflection which he practically
ignores, reciprocity may be destroyed in a calm
atmosphere. In proof of this assertion I would refer him
to a short paper on “Acoustic Reversibility,” printed at
the end of this volume.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> The most remarkable case of
non-reciprocity on record, and which, prior to the demonstration
of the existence and power of acoustic clouds,
remained an insoluble enigma, is there shown to be capable
of satisfactory solution. These clouds explain perfectly
the “abnormal phenomena” of Prof. Henry. Aware
of their existence, the falling off and subsequent recovery
of a signal-sound, as noticed by him and General Duane,
is no more a mystery than the interception of the solar
light by a common cloud, and its restoration after the
cloud has moved or melted away.</p>

<p>The clew to all the difficulties and anomalies of this
question is to be found in the aërial echoes, the signifi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>cance
of which has been overlooked by General Duane,
and misinterpreted by Prof. Henry. And here a word
might be said with regard to the injurious influence still
exercised by authority in science. The affirmations of
the highest authorities, that from clear air no sensible
echo ever comes, were so distinct that my mind for a
time refused to entertain the idea. Authority caused me
for weeks to depart from the truth, and to seek counsel
among delusions. On the day our observations at the
South Foreland began I heard the echoes. They perplexed
me. I heard them again and again, and listened
to the explanations offered by some ingenious persons at
the Foreland. They were an “ocean-echo”: this is the
very phraseology now used by Prof. Henry. They were
echoes “from the crests and slopes of the waves”: these
are the words of the hypothesis which he now espouses.
Through a portion of the month of May, through the
whole of June, and through nearly the whole of July,
1873, I was occupied with these echoes; one of the
phases of thought then passed through, one of the solutions
then weighed in the balance and found wanting,
being identical with that which Prof. Henry now offers
for acceptation.</p>

<p>But though it thus deflected me from the proper
track, shall I say that authority in science is injurious?
Not without some qualification. It is not only injurious,
but deadly, when it cows the intellect into fear of questioning
it. But the authority which so merits our respect
as to compel us to test and overthrow all its supports,
before accepting a conclusion opposed to it, is not wholly
noxious. On the contrary, the disciplines it imposes may
be in the highest degree salutary, though they may end,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
as in the present case, in the ruin of authority. The
truth thus established is rendered firmer by our struggles
to reach it. I groped day after day, carrying this problem
of aërial echoes in my mind; to the weariness, I fear,
of some of my colleagues who did not know my object.
The ships and boats afloat, the “slopes and crests of the
waves,” the visible clouds, the cliffs, the adjacent lighthouses,
the objects landward, were all in turn taken into
account, and all in turn rejected.</p>

<p>With regard to the particular notion which now finds
favor with Prof. Henry, it suggests the thought that his
observations, notwithstanding their apparent variety and
extent, were really limited as regards the weather. For
did they, like ours, embrace weather of all kinds, it is not
likely that he would have ascribed to the sea-waves an
action which often reaches its maximum intensity when
waves are entirely absent. I will not multiply instances,
but confine myself to the definite statement that the
echoes have often manifested an astonishing strength
when the sea was of glassy smoothness. On days when
the echoes were powerful, I have seen the southern
cumuli mirrored in the waveless ocean, in forms almost
as definite as the clouds themselves. By no possible application
of the law of incidence and reflection could the
echoes from such a sea return to the shore; and if we
accept for a moment a statement which Prof. Henry
seems to indorse, that sound-waves of great intensity,
when they impinge upon a solid or liquid surface, do
not obey the law of incidence and reflection, but “roll
along the surface like a cloud of smoke,” it only increases
the difficulty. Such a “cloud,” instead of returning
to the coast of England, would, in our case, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
rolled toward the coast of France. Nothing that I could
say in addition could strengthen the case here presented.
I will only add one further remark. When the sun
shines uniformly on a smooth sea, thus producing a practically
uniform distribution of the aërial currents to which
the echoes are due, the direction in which the trumpet-echoes
reach the shore is always that in which the axis
of the instrument is pointed. At Dungeness this was
proved to be the case throughout an arc of 210°—an impossible
result, if the direction of reflection were determined
by that of the ocean waves.</p>

<p>Rightly interpreted and followed out, these aërial
echoes lead to a solution which penetrates and reconciles
the phenomena from beginning to end. On this
point I would stake the issue of the whole inquiry, and
to this point I would, with special earnestness, direct the
attention of the Lighthouse Board of Washington. Let
them prolong their observations into calm weather: if
their atmosphere resembles ours—which I cannot doubt—then
I affirm that they will infallibly find the echoes
strong on days when all thought of reflection “from the
crests and slopes of the waves” must be discarded. The
echoes afford the easiest access to the core of this question,
and it is for this reason that I dwell upon them
thus emphatically. It requires no refined skill or profound
knowledge to master the conditions of their production;
and these once mastered, the Lighthouse Board
of Washington will find themselves in the real current of
the phenomena, outside of which—I say it with respect—they
are now vainly speculating. The acoustic deportment
of the atmosphere in haze, fog, sleet, snow, rain, and
hail will be no longer a mystery; even those “abnormal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
phenomena” which are now referred to an imaginary
cause, or reserved for future investigation, will be found
to fall naturally into place, as illustrations of a principle
as simple as it is universal.</p>



<p class="tb">“With the instruments now at our disposal wisely
established along our coasts, I venture to think that the
saving of property, in ten years, will be an exceedingly
large multiple of the outlay necessary for the establishment
of such signals. The saving of life appeals to the
higher motives of humanity.” Such were the words with
which I wound up my Report on Fog-Signals.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> One year
after their utterance, the “Schiller” goes to pieces on the
Scilly rocks. A single calamity covers the predicted
multiple, while the sea receives three hundred and thirty-three
victims. As regards the establishment of fog-signals,
energy has been hitherto paralyzed by their
reputed uncertainty. We now know both the reason
and the range of their variations; and such knowledge
places it within our power to prevent disasters like the
recent one. The inefficiency of bells, which caused their
exclusion from our inquiry, was sadly illustrated in the
case of the “Schiller.”</p>

<h2>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In the</span> following pages I have tried to render the science
of Acoustics interesting to all intelligent persons,
including those who do not possess any special scientific
culture.</p>

<p>The subject is treated experimentally throughout, and
I have endeavored so to place each experiment before
the reader that he should realize it as an actual operation.
My desire, indeed, has been to give distinct images
of the various phenomena of acoustics, and to cause them
to be seen mentally in their true relations.</p>

<p>I have been indebted to the kindness of some of my
English friends for a more or less complete examination
of the proof-sheets of this work. To my celebrated German
friend Clausius, who has given himself the trouble
of reading the proofs from beginning to end, my especial
thanks are due and tendered.</p>

<p>There is a growing desire for scientific culture throughout
the civilized world. The feeling is natural, and, under
the circumstances, inevitable. For a power which influences
so mightily the intellectual and material action of
the age could not fail to arrest attention and challenge
examination. In our schools and universities a movement
in favor of science has begun which, no doubt, will
end in the recognition of its claims, both as a source of
knowledge and as a means of discipline. If by showing,
however inadequately, the methods and results of physical
science to men of influence, who derive their culture
from another source, this book should indirectly aid in
promoting the movement referred to, it will not have
been written in vain.</p>

<h3>§ 1. <i>Introduction: Character of Sonorous Motion. Experimental Illustrations</i></h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE various nerves of the human body have their
origin in the brain, which is the seat of sensation.
When the finger is wounded, the sensor nerves
convey to the brain intelligence of the injury, and if
these nerves be severed, however serious the hurt may
be, no pain is experienced. We have the strongest reason
for believing that what the nerves convey to the
brain is in all cases <em>motion</em>. The motion here meant is
not, however, that of the nerve as a whole, but of its
molecules or smallest particles.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>
<p>Different nerves are appropriated to the transmission
of different kinds of molecular motion. The nerves of
taste, for example, are not competent to transmit the
tremors of light, nor is the optic nerve competent to
transmit sonorous vibrations. For these a special nerve
is necessary, which passes from the brain into one of the
cavities of the ear, and there divides into a multitude of
filaments. It is the motion imparted to this, the <em>auditory
nerve</em>, which, in the brain, is translated into sound.</p>

<p>Applying a flame to a small collodion balloon which
contains a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen, the gases
explode, and every ear in this room is conscious of a
shock, which we name a sound. How was this shock
transmitted from the balloon to our organs of hearing?
Have the exploding gases shot the air-particles against
the auditory nerve as a gun shoots a ball against a target?
No doubt, in the neighborhood of the balloon,
there is to some extent a propulsion of particles; but no
particle of air from the vicinity of the balloon reached
the ear of any person here present. The process was
this: When the flame touched the mixed gases they combined
chemically, and their union was accompanied by
the development of intense heat. The heated air expanded
suddenly, forcing the surrounding air violently
away on all sides. This motion of the air close to the
balloon was rapidly imparted to that a little further off,
the air first set in motion coming at the same time to
rest. The air, at a little distance, passed its motion on
to the air at a greater distance, and came also in its turn
to rest. Thus each shell of air, if I may use the term,
surrounding the balloon took up the motion of the shell
next preceding, and transmitted it to the next succeeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
shell, the motion being thus propagated as a <em>pulse</em> or
<em>wave</em> through the air.</p>

<p>The motion of the pulse must not be confounded with
the motion of the particles which at any moment constitute
the pulse. For while the wave moves forward
through considerable distances, each particular particle
of air makes only a small excursion to and fro.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_033.jpg" width="500" height="166" alt="Fig. 1." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The process may be rudely represented by the propagation
of motion through a row of glass balls, such as
are employed in the game of <em>solitaire</em>. Placing the balls
along a groove thus, Fig. 1, each of them touching its
neighbor, and urging one of them against the end of the
row: the motion thus imparted to the first ball is delivered
up to the second, the motion of the second is delivered
up to the third, the motion of the third is imparted
to the fourth; each ball, after having given up its
motion, returning itself to rest. The last ball only of the
row flies away. In a similar way is sound conveyed from
particle to particle through the air. The particles which
fill the cavity of the ear are finally driven against <em>the
tympanic membrane</em>, which is stretched across the passage
leading from the external ear toward the brain. This
membrane, which closes outwardly the “drum” of the
ear, is thrown into vibration, its motion is transmitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
to the ends of the auditory nerve, and afterward along
that nerve to the brain, where the vibrations are translated
into sound. How it is that the motion of the nervous
matter can thus excite the consciousness of sound
is a mystery which the human mind cannot fathom.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_034.jpg" width="300" height="180" alt="Fig. 2." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The propagation of sound may be illustrated by another
homely but useful illustration. I have here five
young assistants, <span class="smcap">A</span>, <span class="smcap">B</span>, <span class="smcap">C</span>, <span class="smcap">D</span>, and <span class="smcap">E</span>, Fig. 2, placed in a
row, one behind the other, each boy’s hands resting
against the back of the boy in front of him. <span class="smcap">E</span> is now
foremost, and <span class="smcap">A</span> finishes the row behind. I suddenly
push <span class="smcap">A</span>, <span class="smcap">A</span> pushes <span class="smcap">B</span>, and regains his upright position; <span class="smcap">B</span>
pushes <span class="smcap">C</span>; <span class="smcap">C</span> pushes <span class="smcap">D</span>; <span class="smcap">D</span> pushes <span class="smcap">E</span>; each boy, after the
transmission of the push, becoming himself erect. <span class="smcap">E</span>, having
nobody in front, is thrown forward. Had he been
standing on the edge of a precipice, he would have fallen
over; had he stood in contact with a window, he would
have broken the glass; had he been close to a drumhead,
he would have shaken the drum. “We could thus
transmit a push through a row of a hundred boys, each
particular boy, however, only swaying to and fro. Thus,
also, we send sound through the air, and shake the drum
of a distant ear, while each particular particle of the air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
concerned in the transmission of the pulse makes only a
small oscillation.</p>

<p>But we have not yet extracted from our row of boys
all that they can teach us. When <span class="smcap">A</span> is pushed he may
yield languidly, and thus tardily deliver up the motion to
his neighbor <span class="smcap">B</span>. <span class="smcap">B</span> may do the same to <span class="smcap">C</span>, <span class="smcap">C</span> to <span class="smcap">D</span>, and <span class="smcap">D</span>
to <span class="smcap">E</span>. In this way the motion might be transmitted with
comparative slowness along the line. But <span class="smcap">A</span>, when
pushed, may, by a sharp muscular effort and sudden
recoil, deliver up promptly his motion to <span class="smcap">B</span>, and come
himself to rest; <span class="smcap">B</span> may do the same to <span class="smcap">C</span>, <span class="smcap">C</span> to <span class="smcap">D</span>, and <span class="smcap">D</span>
to <span class="smcap">E</span>, the motion being thus transmitted rapidly along the
line. Now this sharp muscular effort and sudden recoil is
analogous to the <em>elasticity</em> of the air in the case of sound.
In a wave of sound, a lamina of air, when urged against
its neighbor lamina, delivers up its motion and recoils, in
virtue of the elastic force exerted between them; and the
more rapid this delivery and recoil, or in other words
the greater the elasticity of the air, the greater is the
velocity of the sound.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_035.jpg" width="400" height="64" alt="Fig. 3." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span></div>
</div>

<p>A very instructive mode of illustrating the transmission
of a sound-pulse is furnished by the apparatus represented
in Fig. 3, devised by my assistant, Mr. Cottrell.
It consists of a series of wooden balls separated from
each other by spiral springs. On striking the knob <span class="smcap">A</span>,
a rod attached to it impinges upon the first ball <span class="smcap">B</span>,
which transmits its motion to <span class="smcap">C</span>, thence it passes to <span class="smcap">E</span>,
and so on through the entire series. The arrival at <span class="smcap">D</span> is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
announced by the shock of the terminal ball against the
wood, or, if we wish, by the ringing of a bell. Here the
elasticity of the air is represented by that of the springs.
The pulse may be rendered slow enough to be followed
by the eye.</p>

<p>Scientific education ought to teach us to see the invisible
as well as the visible in nature, to picture with the
vision of the mind those operations which entirely elude
bodily vision; to look at the very atoms of matter in
motion and at rest, and to follow them forth, without
ever once losing sight of them, into the world of the
senses, and see them there integrating themselves in natural
phenomena. With regard to the point now under
consideration, we must endeavor to form a definite image
of a wave of sound. We ought to see mentally the air-particles,
when urged outward by the explosion of our
balloon, crowding closely together; but immediately behind
this condensation we ought to see the particles separated
more widely apart. We must, in short, to be able
to seize the conception that a sonorous wave consists of
two portions, in the one of which the air is more dense,
and in the other of which it is less dense than usual. A
condensation and a rarefaction, then, are the two constituents
of a wave of sound. This conception shall be rendered
more complete in our next lecture.</p>


<h3>§ 2. <i>Experiments in Vacuo, in Hydrogen, and on Mountains</i></h3>



<p>That air is thus necessary to the propagation of sound
was proved by a celebrated experiment made before the
Royal Society, by a philosopher named Hawksbee, in
1705.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> He so fixed a bell within the receiver of an air-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>pump that he could ring the bell when the receiver was
exhausted. Before the air was withdrawn the sound of
the bell was heard within the receiver; after the air was
withdrawn the sound became so faint as to be hardly
perceptible. An arrangement is before you which enables
us to repeat in a very perfect manner the experiment
of Hawksbee. Within this jar, <span class="smcap">G G</span>′, Fig. 4, resting
on the plate of an air-pump is a
<span class="figright200">
<img src="images/i_037.jpg" width="200" height="390" alt="Fig. 4." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span></span>
</span>
bell, <span class="smcap">B</span>, associated with cloc-kwork.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>
After the jar has been exhausted
as perfectly as possible, I release,
by means of a rod, <i>r r′</i>, which
passes air-tight through the top
of the vessel, the detent which
holds the hammer. It strikes,
and you see it striking, but only
those close to the bell can hear
the sound. Hydrogen gas, which
you know is fourteen times lighter
than air, is now allowed to enter
the vessel. The sound of the bell
is not augmented by the presence
of this attenuated gas, though the
receiver is now full of it. By
working the pump, the atmosphere
round the bell is rendered still more attenuated.
In this way we obtain a vacuum more perfect than that
of Hawksbee, and this is important, for it is the last
traces of air that are chiefly effective in this experiment.
You now see the hammer pounding the bell, but you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>hear no sound. Even when the ear is placed against
the exhausted receiver not the faintest tinkle is heard.
Observe also that the bell is suspended by strings, for
if it were allowed to rest upon the plate of the air-pump
the vibrations would be communicated to the plate, and
thence transmitted to the air outside. Permitting the air
to enter the jar with as little noise as possible, you immediately
hear a feeble sound, which grows louder as the
air becomes more dense, until finally every person in this
large assembly distinctly hears the ringing of the bell.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>Sir John Leslie found hydrogen singularly incompetent
to act as the vehicle of the sound of a bell rung in the
gas. More than this, he emptied a receiver like that before
you of half its air, and plainly heard the ringing of
the bell. On permitting hydrogen to enter the half-filled
receiver until it was wholly filled, the sound sank until
it was scarcely audible. This result remained an enigma
until it received a simple and satisfactory explanation at
the hands of Prof. Stokes. When a common pendulum
oscillates it tends to form a condensation in front and a
rarefaction behind. But it is only <em>a tendency</em>; the motion
is so slow, and the air is so elastic, that it moves away
in front before it is sensibly condensed, and fills the
space behind before it can become sensibly dilated.
Hence waves or pulses are not generated by the pendulum.
It requires a certain sharpness of shock to produce
the condensation and rarefaction which constitute
a wave of sound in air.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>
<p>The more elastic and mobile the gas, the more able
will it be to move away in front and to fill the space
behind, and thus to oppose the formation of rarefactions
and condensations by a vibrating body. Now hydrogen
is much more mobile than air; and hence the production
of sonorous waves in it is attended with greater difficulty
than in air. A rate of vibration quite competent to produce
sound-waves in the one may be wholly incompetent
to produce them in the other. Both calculation and observation
prove the correctness of this explanation, to
which we shall again refer.</p>

<p>At great elevations in the atmosphere sound is sensibly
diminished in loudness. De Saussure thought the
explosion of a pistol at the summit of Mont Blanc to be
about equal to that of a common cracker below. I have
several times repeated this experiment; first, in default of
anything better, with a little tin cannon, the torn remnants
of which are now before you, and afterward with
pistols. What struck me was the absence of that density
and sharpness in the sound which characterize it at
lower elevations. The pistol-shot resembled the explosion
of a champagne bottle, but it was still loud. The
withdrawal of half an atmosphere does not very materially
affect our ringing bell, and air of the density found
at the top of Mont Blanc is still capable of powerfully
affecting the auditory nerve. That highly attenuated air
is able to convey sound of great intensity is forcibly
illustrated by the explosion of meteorites at elevations
where the tenuity of the atmosphere must be almost infinite.
Here, however, the initial disturbance must be
exceedingly great.</p>

<p>The motion of sound, like all other motion, is en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>feebled
by its transference from a light body to a heavy
one. When the receiver which has hitherto covered our
bell is removed you hear how much more loudly it rings
in the open air. When the bell was covered the aërial
vibrations were first communicated to the heavy glass
jar, and afterward by the jar to the air outside; a great
diminution of intensity being the consequence. The action
of hydrogen gas upon the voice is an illustration of
the same kind. The voice is formed by urging air from
the lungs through an organ called the larynx, where it is
thrown into vibration by the <em>vocal chords</em> which thus generate
sound. But when the lungs are filled with hydrogen,
the vocal chords on speaking produce a vibratory
motion in the hydrogen, which then transfers the motion
to the outer air. By this transference from a light gas
to a heavy one the voice is so weakened as to become a
mere squeak.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>The intensity of a sound depends on the density of
the air in which the sound is generated, and not on that
of the air in which it is heard.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> Supposing the summit
of Mont Blanc to be equally distant from the top of the
Aiguille Verte and the bridge at Chamouni; and supposing
two observers stationed, the one upon the bridge and
the other upon the Aiguille: the report of a cannon fired
on Mont Blanc would reach both observers with the
same intensity, though in the one case the sound would
pursue its way through the rare air above, while in the
other it would descend though the denser air below.
Again, let a straight line equal to that from the bridge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>at Chamouni to the summit of Mont Blanc be measured
along the earth’s surface in the valley of Chamouni, and
let two observers be stationed, the one on the summit
and the other at the end of the line: the report of a cannon
fired on the bridge would reach both observers with
the same intensity, though in the one case the sound
would be propagated through the dense air of the valley,
and in the other case would ascend through the rarer air
of the mountain. Finally, charge two cannon equally,
and fire one of them at Chamouni and the other at the
top of Mont Blanc: the one fired in the heavy air below
may be heard above, while the one fired in the light air
above is unheard below.</p>


<h3>§ 3. <i>Intensity of Sound. Law of Inverse Squares</i></h3>

<p>In the case of our exploding balloon the wave of
sound expands on all sides, the motion produced by the
explosion being thus diffused over a continually augmenting
mass of air. It is perfectly manifest that this cannot
occur without an enfeeblement of the motion. Take the
case of a thin shell of air with a radius of one foot, reckoned
from the centre of explosion. A shell of air of the
same thickness, but of two feet radius, will contain four
times the quantity of matter; if its radius be three feet, it
will contain nine times the quantity of matter; if four
feet, it will contain sixteen times the quantity of matter,
and so on. Thus the quantity of matter set in motion
<em>augments</em> as the square of the distance from the centre of
explosion. The intensity or loudness of sound <em>diminishes</em>
in the same proportion. We express this law by saying
that the intensity of the sound <em>varies inversely as the
square of the distance</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<p>Let us look at the matter in another light. The mechanical
effect of a ball striking a target depends on two
things—the weight of the ball, and the velocity with
which it moves. The effect is proportional to the weight
simply; but it is proportional to the square of the velocity.
The proof of this is easy, but it belongs to ordinary
mechanics rather than to our present subject. Now
what is true of the cannon-ball striking a target is also
true of an air-particle striking the tympanum of the ear.
Fix your attention upon a particle of air as the sound-wave
passes over it; it is urged from its position of rest
toward a neighbor particle, first with an accelerated motion,
and then with a retarded one. The force which first
urges it is opposed by the resistance of the air, which
finally stops the particle and causes it to recoil. At a
certain point of its excursion the velocity of the particle
is its maximum. <em>The intensity of the sound is proportional
to the square of this maximum velocity.</em></p>

<p>The distance through which the air-particle moves to
and fro, when the sound-wave passes it, is called the
<em>amplitude</em> of the vibration. The intensity of the sound is
proportional to the square of the amplitude.</p>


<h3>§ 4. <i>Confinement of Sound-waves in Tubes</i></h3>

<p>This weakening of the sound, according to the law of
inverse squares, would not take place if the sound-wave
were so confined as to prevent its lateral diffusion. By
sending it through a tube with a smooth interior surface
we accomplish this, and the wave thus confined may be
transmitted to great distances with very little diminution
of intensity. Into one end of this tin tube, fifteen feet
long, I whisper in a manner quite inaudible to the peo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>ple
nearest to me, but a listener at the other end hears
me distinctly. If a watch be placed at one end of the
tube, a person at the other end hears the ticks, though
nobody else does. At the distant end of the tube is now
placed a lighted candle, <i>c</i>, <a href="#f5">Fig. 5.</a> When the hands are
clapped at this end, the flame instantly ducks down at
the other. It is not quite extinguished, but it is forcibly
depressed. When two books, <span class="smcap">B B′</span>, Fig. 5, are clapped
together, the candle is blown out.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> You may here observe,
in a rough way, the speed with which the sound-wave
is propagated. The instant the clap is heard the
flame is extinguished. I do not say that the time required
by the sound to travel this tube is immeasurably
short, but simply that the interval is too short for your
senses to appreciate it.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="f5" id="f5">
<img src="images/i_043.jpg" width="500" height="160" alt="Fig. 5." /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span></div>
</div>

<p>That it is a <em>pulse</em> and not a <em>puff</em> of air is proved by
filling one end of the tube with the smoke of brown
paper. On clapping the books together no trace of this
smoke is ejected from the other end. The pulse has
passed through both smoke and air without carrying
either of them along with it.</p>

<p>An effective mode of throwing the propagation of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>pulse through air has been devised by my assistant. The
two ends of a tin tube fifteen feet long are stopped by
sheet India-rubber stretched across them. At one end, <i>e</i>,
a hammer with a spring handle rests against the India-rubber;
at the other end is an arrangement for the striking
of a bell, <i>c</i>. Drawing back the hammer <i>e</i> to a distance
measured on the graduated circle and liberating it,
the generated pulse is propagated through the tube,
strikes the other end, drives away the cork termination
<i>a</i> of the lever <i>a b</i>, and causes the hammer <i>b</i> to strike
the bell. The rapidity of propagation is well illustrated
here. When hydrogen (sent through the India-rubber
tube <span class="smcap">H</span>) is substituted for air the bell does not ring.</p>

<p>The celebrated French philosopher, Biot, observed the
transmission of sound through the empty water-pipes of
Paris, and found that he could hold a conversation in a
low voice through an iron tube 3,120 feet in length.
The lowest possible whisper, indeed, could be heard at
this distance, while the firing of a pistol into one end of
the tube quenched a lighted candle at the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<h3>§ 5. <i>The Reflection of Sound. Resemblances to Light</i></h3>

<p>The action of sound thus illustrated is exactly the
same as that of light and radiant heat. They, like
sound, are wave-motions. Like sound they diffuse themselves
in space, diminishing in intensity according to the
same law. Like sound also, light and radiant heat, when
sent through a tube with a reflecting interior surface,
may be conveyed to great distances with comparatively
little loss. In fact, every experiment on the reflection of
light has its analogy in the reflection of sound. On yonder
gallery stands an electric lamp, placed close to the
clock of this lecture-room. An assistant in the gallery
ignites the lamp, and directs its powerful beam upon a
mirror placed here behind the lecture-table. By the act
of reflection the divergent beam is converted into this
splendid luminous cone traced out upon the dust of the
room. The point of convergence being marked and the
lamp extinguished, I place my ear at that point. Here
every sound-wave sent forth by the clock and reflected
by the mirror is gathered up, and the ticks are heard as
if they came, not from the clock, but from the mirror.
Let us stop the clock, and place a watch <i>w</i>, <a href="#f7">Fig. 7</a>, at
the place occupied a moment ago by the electric light.
At this great distance the ticking of the watch is distinctly
heard. The hearing is much aided by introducing
the end <i>f</i> of a glass funnel into the ear, the funnel here
acting the part of an ear-trumpet. We know, moreover,
that in optics the positions of a body and of its image
are reversible. When a candle is placed at this lower
focus, you see its image on the gallery above, and I
have only to turn the mirror on its stand to make the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
image of the flame fall upon any one of the row of persons
who occupy the front seat in the gallery. Removing
the candle, and putting the watch, <i>w</i>, Fig. 8, in its
place, the person on whom the light falls distinctly hears
the sound. When the ear is assisted by the glass funnel,
the reflected ticks of the clock in our first experiment
are so powerful as to suggest the idea of something
pounding against the tympanum, while the direct ticks
are scarcely if at all, heard.</p>

<p>One of these two parabolic mirrors, <i>n n′</i>, Fig. 9, is
placed upon the table, the other, <i>m m′</i>, being drawn up
to the ceiling of this theatre; they are five-and-twenty
feet apart. When the carbon-points of the electric light
are placed in the focus <i>a</i> of the lower mirror and ignited,
a fine luminous cylinder rises like a pillar to the upper
<span class="figright250">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 9.</span></span>
</span>
mirror, which brings the
parallel beam to a focus.
At that focus is seen a
spot of sunlike brilliancy,
due to the reflection of
the light from the surface
of a watch, <i>w</i>, there
suspended. The watch is
ticking, but in my present
position I do not hear
it. At this lower focus,
<i>a</i>, however, we have the
energy of every sonorous
wave converged. Placing
the ear at <i>a</i>, the ticking
is as audible as if the
watch were at hand; the
sound, as in the former
case, appearing to proceed,
not from the watch itself, but from the lower mirror.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>



<p>Curved roofs and ceilings and bellying sails act as
mirrors upon sound. In our old laboratory, for example,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>the singing of a kettle seemed, in certain positions, to
come, not from the fire on which it was placed, but from
the ceiling. Inconvenient secrets have been thus revealed,
an instance of which has been cited by Sir John Herschel.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>
In one of the cathedrals in Sicily the confessional
was so placed that the whispers of the penitents were reflected
by the curved roof, and brought to a focus at a
distant part of the edifice. The focus was discovered by
accident, and for some time the person who discovered it
took pleasure in hearing, and in bringing his friends to
hear, utterances intended for the priest alone. One day,
it is said, his own wife occupied the penitential stool, and
both he and his friends were thus made acquainted with
secrets which were the reverse of amusing to one of the
party.</p>

<p>When a sufficient interval exists between a direct and
a reflected sound, we hear the latter as an <em>echo</em>.</p>

<p>Sound, like light, may be reflected several times in
succession, and, as the reflected light under these circumstances
becomes gradually feebler to the eye, so the successive
echoes become gradually feebler to the ear. In
mountain regions this repetition and decay of sound produce
wonderful and pleasing effects. Visitors to Killarney
will remember the fine echo in the Gap of Dunloe.
When a trumpet is sounded in the proper place in the
Gap, the sonorous waves reach the ear in succession after
one, two, three, or more reflections from the adjacent
cliffs, and thus die away in the sweetest cadences. There
is a deep <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cul-de-sac</em>, called the Ochsenthal, formed by the
great cliffs of the Engelhörner, near Rosenlaui, in Switzerland,
where the echoes warble in a wonderful manner.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>
<p>The sound of the Alpine horn, echoed from the rocks of
the Wetterhorn or the Jungfrau, is in the first instance
heard roughly. But by successive reflections the notes
are rendered more soft and flute-like, the gradual diminution
of intensity giving the impression that the source of
sound is retreating further and further into the solitudes
of ice and snow. The repetition of echoes is also in part
due to the fact that the reflecting surfaces are at different
distances from the hearer.</p>

<p>In large, unfurnished rooms the mixture of direct and
reflected sound sometimes produces very curious effects.
Standing, for example, in the gallery of the Bourse at
Paris, you hear the confused vociferation of the excited
multitude below. You see all the motions—of their lips
as well as of their hands and arms. You know they are
speaking—often, indeed, with vehemence—but what they
say you know not. The voices mix with their echoes into
a chaos of noise, out of which no intelligible utterance
can emerge. The echoes of a room are materially damped
by its furniture. The presence of an audience may also
render intelligible speech possible where, without an audience,
the definition of the direct voice is destroyed by its
echoes. On the 16th of May, 1865, having to lecture in
the Senate House of the University of Cambridge, I first
made some experiments as to the loudness of voice necessary
to fill the room, and was dismayed to find that a
friend, placed at a distant part of the hall, could not follow
me because of the echoes. The assembled audience,
however, so quenched the sonorous waves that the echoes
were practically absent, and my voice was plainly heard
in all parts of the Senate House.</p>

<p>Sounds are also said to be reflected from the clouds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
Arago reports that, when the sky is clear, the report of
a cannon on an open plain is short and sharp, while a
cloud is sufficient to produce an echo like the rolling of
distant thunder. The subject of aërial echoes will be
subsequently treated at length, when it will be shown
that Arago’s conclusion requires correction.</p>

<p>Sir John Herschel, in his excellent article “Sound,”
In the “Encyclopædia Metropolitana,” has collected with
others the following instances of echoes. An echo in
Woodstock Park repeats seventeen syllables by day and
twenty by night; one, on the banks of the Lago del
Lupo, above the fall of Terni, repeats fifteen. The tick
of a watch may be heard from one end of the abbey
church of St. Albans to the other. In Gloucester Cathedral,
a gallery of an octagonal form conveys a whisper
seventy-five feet across the nave. In the whispering-gallery
of St. Paul’s, the faintest sound is conveyed from
one side to the other of the dome, but is not heard at
any intermediate point. At Carisbrook Castle, in the Isle
of Wight, is a well two hundred and ten feet deep and
twelve wide. The interior is lined by smooth masonry;
when a pin is dropped into the well it is distinctly heard
to strike the water. Shouting or coughing into this well
produces a resonant ring of some duration.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<h3>§ 6. <i>Refraction of Sound</i></h3>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="f10" id="f10">
<img src="images/i_051.jpg" width="500" height="194" alt="Fig. 10." /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Another important analogy between sound and light
has been established by M. Sondhauss.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> When a large
lens is placed in front of our lamp, the lens compels the
rays of light that fall upon it to deviate from their direct
and divergent course, and to form a convergent cone behind
it. This refraction of the luminous beam is a consequence
of the retardation suffered by the light in passing
through the glass. Sound may be similarly refracted
by causing it to pass through a lens which retards its
motion. Such a lens is formed when we fill a thin balloon
with some gas heavier than air. A collodion balloon,
<span class="smcap">B</span>, <a href="#f10">Fig. 10</a>, filled with carbonic-acid gas, the envelope
being so thin as to yield readily to the pulses which
strike against it, answers the purpose.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> A watch, <i>w</i>, is
hung up close to the lens, beyond which, and at a distance
of four or five feet from the lens, is placed the ear,
assisted by the glass funnel <i>f f′</i>. By moving the head
about, a position is soon discovered in which the ticking
is particularly loud. This, in fact, is the focus of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>lens. If the ear be moved from this focus the intensity
of the sound falls; if, when the ear is at the focus, the
balloon be removed, the ticks are enfeebled; on replacing
the balloon their force is restored. The lens, in fact,
enables us to hear the ticks distinctly when they are perfectly
inaudible to the unaided ear.</p>




<p>How a sound-wave is thus converged may be comprehended
by reference to Fig. 11. Let <i>m o n o″</i> be a section
of the sound-lens, and <i>a b</i> a portion of a sonorous
wave approaching it from a distance. The middle point,
<i>o</i>, of the wave first touches the lens, and is first retarded
<span class="figright200">
<img src="images/i_052.jpg" width="200" height="177" alt="Fig. 11." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span></span>
</span>
by it.  By the time the ends
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, still moving through
air, reach the balloon, the middle
point <i>o</i>, pursuing its way through
the heavier gas within, will have
only reached <i>o′</i>. The wave is
therefore broken at <i>o</i>; and the
direction of motion being at right
angles to the face of the wave,
the two halves will encroach upon each other.  This
convergence of the two halves of the wave is augmented
on quitting the lens. For when <i>o′</i> has reached <i>o″</i>, the
two ends <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> will have pushed forward to a greater
distance, say to <i>a′</i> and <i>b′</i>. Soon afterward the two halves
of the wave will cross each other, or in other words
come to a focus, the air at the focus being agitated by
the sum of the motions of the two waves.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span></p>

<h3>§ 7. <i>Diffraction of Sound: illustrations offered by
great Explosions</i></h3>

<p>When a long sea-roller meets an isolated rock in its
passage, it rises against the rock and embraces it all
round. Facts of this nature caused Newton to reject the
undulatory theory of light. He contended that if light
were a product of wave-motion we could have no shadows,
because the waves of light would propagate themselves
round opaque bodies as a wave of water round a
rock. It has been proved since his time that the waves
of light do bend round opaque bodies; but with that we
have nothing now to do. A sound-wave certainly bends
thus round an obstacle, though as it diffuses itself in the
air at the back of the obstacle it is enfeebled in power,
the obstacle thus producing a partial <em>shadow</em> of the
sound. A railway train passing through cuttings and
long embankments exhibits great variations in the intensity
of the sound. The interposition of a hill in the
Alps suffices to diminish materially the sound of a cataract;
it is able sensibly to extinguish the tinkle of the
cowbells. Still the sound-shadow is but partial, and the
marker at the rifle-butts never fails to hear the explosion,
though he is well protected from the ball. A striking
example of this <em>diffraction</em> of a sonorous wave was
exhibited at Erith after the tremendous explosion of a
powder magazine which occurred there in 1864. The village
of Erith was some miles distant from the magazine,
but in nearly all cases the windows were shattered; and
it was noticeable that the windows turned away from the
origin of the explosion suffered almost as much as those
which faced it. Lead sashes were employed in Erith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
Church, and these, being in some degree flexible, enabled
the windows to yield to pressure without much
fracture of the glass. As the sound-wave reached the
church it separated right and left, and, for a moment,
the edifice was clasped by a girdle of intensely compressed
air, every window in the church, front and back,
being bent <em>inward</em>. After compression, the air within the
church no doubt dilated, tending to restore the windows
to their first condition. The bending in of the windows,
however, produced but a small condensation of the whole
mass of air within the church; the recoil was therefore
feeble in comparison with the pressure, and insufficient
to undo what the latter had accomplished.</p>


<h3>§ 8. <i>Velocity of Sound: relation to Density and
Elasticity of Air</i></h3>

<p>Two conditions determine the velocity of propagation
of a sonorous wave; namely, the elasticity and the density
of the medium through which the wave passes. The
elasticity of air is measured by the pressure which it sustains
or can hold in equilibrium. At the sea-level this
pressure is equal to that of a stratum of mercury about
thirty inches high. At the summit of Mont Blanc the
barometric column is not much more than half this
height; and, consequently, the elasticity of the air upon
the summit of the mountain is not much more than half
what it is at the sea-level.</p>

<p>If we could augment the elasticity of air, without at
the same time augmenting its density, we should augment
the velocity of sound. Or, if allowing the elasticity to
remain constant we could diminish the density, we should
augment the velocity. Now, air in a closed vessel, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
it cannot expand, has its elasticity augmented by heat,
while its density remains unchanged. Through such
heated air sound travels more rapidly than through
cold air. Again, air free to expand has its density lessened
by warming, its elasticity remaining the same, and
through such air sound travels more rapidly than through
cold air. This is the case with our atmosphere when
heated by the sun.</p>

<p>The velocity of sound in air, <i>at the freezing temperature</i>,
is 1,090 feet a second.</p>

<p>At all lower temperatures the velocity is less than
this, and at all higher temperatures it is greater. The
late M. Wertheim has determined the velocity of sound
in air of different temperatures, and here are some of
his results:</p>

<table summary="velocity" border="0"><tr>
<td class="tdc" colspan="2">Temperature of air</td><td class="tdc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Velocity of sound</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdl">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0·5°</td><td>centigrade</td><td class="tdc">&nbsp;1,089 feet</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdl">&nbsp;&nbsp;2·10</td><td class="tdc">”&nbsp;</td><td class="tdc">1,091&nbsp;&nbsp;”&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr><tr>

<td class="tdl">26·6</td><td class="tdc">”&nbsp;</td><td class="tdc">1,140&nbsp;&nbsp;”&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr></table>


<p>At a temperature of half a degree above the freezing-point
of water the velocity is 1,089 feet a second; at a
temperature of 26·6 degrees, it is 1,140 feet a second, or
a difference of 51 feet for 26 degrees; that is to say, an
augmentation of velocity of nearly two feet for every
single degree centigrade.</p>

<p>With the same elasticity the density of hydrogen gas
is much less than that of air, and the consequence is that
the velocity of sound in hydrogen far exceeds its velocity
in air. The reverse holds good for heavy carbonic-acid
gas. If density and elasticity vary in the same proportion,
as the law of Boyle and Mariotte proves them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
do in air when the temperature is preserved constant,
they neutralize each other’s effects; hence, if the temperature
were the same, the velocity of sound upon the
summits of the highest Alps would be the same as that
at the mouth of the Thames. But, inasmuch as the air
above is colder than that below, the actual velocity on
the summits of the mountains is less than that at the
sea-level. To express this result in stricter language, the
velocity is <em>directly</em> proportional to the square root of the
elasticity of the air; it is also <em>inversely</em> proportional to
the square root of the density of the air. Consequently,
as in air of a constant temperature elasticity and density
vary in the same proportion, and act oppositely, the velocity
of sound is not affected by a change of density, if
unaccompanied by a change of temperature.</p>

<p>There is no mistake more common than to suppose
the velocity of sound to be augmented by density. The
mistake has arisen from a misconception of the fact that
in solids and liquids the velocity is greater than in
gases. But it is the higher elasticity of those bodies, <em>in
relation to their density</em>, that causes sound to pass rapidly
through them. Other things remaining the same, an augmentation
of density always produces a diminution of velocity.
Were the elasticity of water, which is measured
by its compressibility, only equal to that of air, the velocity
of sound in water, instead of being more than
quadruple the velocity in air, would be only a small fraction
of that velocity. Both density and elasticity, then,
must be always borne in mind; the velocity of sound
being determined by neither taken separately, but by the
relation of the one to the other. The effect of small density
and high elasticity is exemplified in an astonishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
manner by the luminiferous ether, which transmits the
vibrations of light—not at the rate of so many feet, but
at the rate of nearly two hundred thousand miles a
second.</p>

<p>Those who are unacquainted with the details of scientific
investigation have no idea of the amount of labor
expended in the determination of those numbers on
which important calculations or inferences depend. They
have no idea of the patience shown by a Berzelius in
determining atomic weights; by a Regnault in determining
coefficients of expansion; or by a Joule in determining
the mechanical equivalent of heat. There is a
morality brought to bear upon such matters which, in
point of severity, is probably without a parallel in any
other domain of intellectual action. Thus, as regards the
determination of the velocity of sound in air, hours
might be filled with a simple statement of the efforts
made to establish it with precision. The question has
occupied the attention of experimenters in England,
France, Germany, Italy, and Holland. But to the French
and Dutch philosophers we owe the application of the
last refinements of experimental skill to the solution of
the problem. They neutralized effectually the influence
of the wind; they took into account barometric pressure,
temperature, and hygrometric condition. Sounds were
started at the same moment from two distant stations,
and thus caused to travel from station to station through
the self-same air. The distance between the stations was
determined by exact trigonometrical observations, and
means were devised for measuring with the utmost accuracy
the time required by the sound to pass from the
one station to the other. This time, expressed in sec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>onds,
divided into the distance expressed in feet, gave
1,090 feet per second as the velocity of sound through
air at the temperature of 0° centigrade.</p>

<p>The time required by light to travel over all terrestrial
distances is practically zero; and in the experiments
just referred to the moment of explosion was marked by
the flash of a gun, the time occupied by the sound in
passing from station to station being the interval observed
between the appearance of the flash and the arrival
of the sound. The velocity of sound in air once
established, it is plain that we can apply it to the determination
of distances. By observing, for example, the
interval between the appearance of a flash of lightning
and the arrival of the accompanying thunder-peal, we at
once determine the distance of the place of discharge. It
is only when the interval between the flash and peal is
short that danger from lightning is to be apprehended.</p>


<h3>§ 9. <i>Theoretic Velocity calculated by Newton
Laplace’s Correction</i></h3>

<p>We now come to one of the most delicate points in
the whole theory of sound. The velocity through air has
been determined by direct experiment; but knowing the
elasticity and density of the air, it is possible, without
any experiment at all, to calculate the velocity with
which a sound-wave is transmitted through it. Sir Isaac
Newton made this calculation, and found the velocity at
the freezing temperature to be 916 feet a second. This is
about one-sixth less than actual observation had proved
the velocity to be, and the most curious suppositions
were made to account for the discrepancy. Newton himself
threw out the conjecture that it was only in passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
from particle to particle of the air that sound required
<em>time</em> for its transmission; that it moved instantaneously
<em>through the particles themselves</em>. He then supposed the
line along which sound passes to be occupied by air-particles
for one-sixth of its extent, and thus he sought
to make good the missing velocity. The very art and ingenuity
of this assumption were sufficient to throw doubt
on it; other theories were therefore advanced, but the
great French mathematician Laplace was the first
<span class="figright75">
<img src="images/i_059.jpg" width="75" height="451" alt="Fig. 12." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span></span>
</span>
to completely solve the enigma. I shall now endeavor
to make you thoroughly acquainted with
his solution.</p>



<p>Into this strong cylinder of glass, <span class="smcap">T U</span>, Fig. 12,
which is accurately bored, and quite smooth
within, fits an air-tight piston. By pushing the
piston down, I condense the air beneath it,
heat being at the same time developed. A
scrap of amadou attached to the bottom of the
piston is ignited by the heat generated by compression.
If a bit of cotton wool dipped into
bisulphide of carbon be attached to the piston,
when the latter is forced down, a flash of light,
due to the ignition of the bisulphide of carbon
vapor, is observed within the tube. It is thus
proved that when air is compressed heat is generated.
By another experiment it may be shown that when air
is rarefied cold is developed. This brass box contains a
quantity of condensed air. I open the cock, and permit
the air to discharge itself against a suitable thermometer;
the sinking of the instrument immediately declares the
chilling of the air.</p>

<p>All that you have heard regarding the transmission of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
a sonorous pulse through air is, I trust, still fresh in your
minds. As the pulse advances it squeezes the particles
of air together, and two results follow from this compression.
First, its elasticity is augmented through the
mere augmentation of its density. Secondly, its elasticity
is augmented by the heat of compression. It was the
change of elasticity which resulted from a change of density
that Newton took into account, and he entirely overlooked
the augmentation of elasticity due to the second
cause just mentioned. Over and above, then, the elasticity
involved in Newton’s calculation, we have an additional
elasticity due to changes of temperature produced
by the sound-wave itself. When both are taken into account,
the calculated and the observed velocities agree
perfectly.</p>

<p>But here, without due caution, we may fall into the
gravest error. In fact, in dealing with Nature, the mind
must be on the alert to seize all her conditions; otherwise
we soon learn that our thoughts are not in accordance
with her facts. It is to be particularly noted that
the augmentation of velocity due to the changes of temperature
produced by the sonorous wave itself is totally
different from the augmentation arising from the heating
of the general mass of the air. The <em>average</em> temperature
of the air is unchanged by the waves of sound. We cannot
have a condensed pulse without having a rarefied
one associated with it. But in the rarefaction, the temperature
of the air is as much lowered as it is raised in
the condensation. Supposing, then, the atmosphere parcelled
out into such condensations and rarefactions, with
their respective temperatures, an extraneous sound passing
through such an atmosphere would be as much re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>tarded
in the latter as accelerated in the former, and no
variation of the average velocity could result from such
a distribution of temperature.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="f13" id="f13">
<img src="images/i_061.jpg" width="500" height="156" alt="Fig. 13." /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Whence, then, does the augmentation pointed out by
Laplace arise? I would ask your best attention while I
endeavor to make this knotty point clear to you. If air
be compressed it becomes smaller in volume; if the pressure
be diminished, the volume expands. The force which
resists compression, and which produces expansion, is
the elastic force of the air. Thus an external pressure
squeezes the air-particles together; their own elastic force
holds them asunder, and the particles are in equilibrium
when these two forces are in equilibrium. Hence it is
that the external pressure is a measure of the elastic
force. Let the middle row of dots, <a href="#f13">Fig. 13</a>, represent a
series of air-particles in a state of quiescence between the
points <i>a</i> and <i>x</i>. Then, because of the elastic force exerted
between the particles, if any one of them be moved
from its position of rest, the motion will be transmitted
through the entire series. Supposing the particle <i>a</i> to be
driven by the prong of a tuning-fork, or some other vibrating
body, toward <i>x</i>, so as to be caused finally to occupy
the position <i>a′</i> in the lowest row of particles: at the
instant the excursion of <i>a</i> commences, its motion begins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
to be transmitted to <i>b</i>. In the next following moments <i>b</i>
transmits the motion to <i>c</i>, <i>c</i> to <i>d</i>, <i>d</i> to <i>e</i>, and so on. So
that by the time <i>a</i> has reached the position <i>a′</i>, the motion
will have been propagated to some point <i>o′</i> of the line of
particles more or less distant from <i>a′</i>. The entire series
of particles between <i>a′</i> and <i>o′</i> is then in a state of condensation.
The distance <i>a′ o′</i>, over which the motion has
travelled during the excursion of <i>a</i> to <i>a′</i>, will depend
upon the elastic force exerted between the particles. Fix
your attention on any two of the particles, say <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>.
The elastic force between them may be figured as a
spiral spring, and it is plain that the more flaccid this
spring the more sluggish would be the communication of
the motion from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>; while the stiffer the spring the
more prompt would be the communication of the motion.
What is true of <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> is true for every other pair of
particles between <i>a</i> and <i>o</i>. Now the spring between
every pair of these particles <em>is suddenly stiffened</em> by the
heat developed along the line of condensation, and hence
the velocity of propagation is augmented by this heat.
Reverting to our old experiment with the row of boys,
it is as if, by the very act of pushing his neighbor, the
muscular rigidity of each boy’s arm was increased, thus
enabling him to deliver his push more promptly than he
would have done without this increase of rigidity. The
<em>condensed</em> portion of a sonorous wave is propagated in the
manner here described, and it is plain that the velocity
of propagation is augmented by the heat developed in
the condensation.</p>

<p>Let us now turn our thoughts for a moment to the
propagation of the rarefaction. Supposing, as before, the
middle row <i>a x</i> to represent the particles of air in equi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>librium
under the pressure of the atmosphere, and suppose
the particle <i>a</i> to be suddenly drawn to the right, so
as to occupy the position <i>a″</i> in the highest line of dots:
<i>a″</i> is immediately followed by <i>b″</i>, <i>b″</i> by <i>c″</i>, <i>c″</i> by <i>d″</i>, <i>d″</i> by
<i>e″</i>; and thus the rarefaction is propagated backward
toward <i>x″</i>, reaching a point <i>o″</i> in the line of particles by
the time <i>a</i> has completed its motion to the right. Now,
why does <i>b″</i> follow <i>a″</i> when <i>a″</i> is drawn away from it?
Manifestly because the elastic force exerted between <i>b″</i>
and <i>a″</i> is less than that between <i>b″</i> and <i>c″</i>. In fact, <i>b″</i>
will be driven after <i>a″</i> by a force equal to the difference
of the two elasticities between <i>a″</i> and <i>b″</i> and between <i>b″</i>
and <i>c″</i>. The same remark applies to the motion of <i>c″</i>
after <i>b″</i>, to that of <i>d″</i> after <i>c″</i>, in fact, to the motion of
each succeeding particle when it follows its predecessor.
The greater the difference of elasticity on the two sides
of any particle the more promptly will it follow its predecessor.
And here observe what the <em>cold</em> of rarefaction
accomplishes. In addition to the diminution of the elastic
force between <i>a″</i> and <i>b″</i> by the withdrawal of <i>a″</i> to a
greater distance, there is a further diminution due to the
lowering of the temperature. <em>The cold developed augments
the difference of elastic force on which the propagation of
the rarefaction depends.</em> Thus we see that because the
heat developed in the condensation augments the rapidity
of the condensation, and because the cold developed in
the rarefaction augments the rapidity of the rarefaction,
the sonorous wave, which consists of a condensation and
a rarefaction, must have its velocity augmented by the
heat <em>and the cold</em> which it develops during its own
progress.</p>

<p>It is worth while fixing your attention here upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
fact that the distance <i>a′ o′</i>, to which the motion has been
propagated while <i>a</i> is moving to the position <i>a′</i>, may be
vastly greater than that passed over in the same time by
the particle itself. The excursion of <i>a′</i> may not be more
than a small fraction of an inch, while the distance to
which the motion is transferred during the time required
by <i>a′</i> to perform this small excursion may be many feet,
or even many yards. If this point should not appear
altogether plain to you now, it will appear so by and by.</p>


<h3>§ 10. <i>Ratio of Specific Heats of Air deduced from
Velocity of Sound</i></h3>

<p>Having grasped this, even partially, I will ask you to
accompany me to a remote corner of the domain of physics,
with the view, however, of showing that remoteness
does not imply discontinuity. Let a certain quantity of
air at a temperature of 0°, contained in a perfectly inexpansible
vessel, have its temperature raised 1°. Let the
same quantity of air, placed in a vessel which permits
the air to expand when it is heated—the pressure on the
air being kept constant during its expansion—also have
its temperature raised 1°. The quantities of heat employed
in the two cases are different. The one quantity
expresses what is called the specific heat of air at constant
volume; the other the specific heat of air at
constant pressure.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> It is an instance of the manner in
which apparently unrelated natural phenomena are bound
together, that from the calculated and observed velocities
of sound in air we can deduce the ratio of these two
specific heats. Squaring Newton’s theoretic velocity and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
the observed velocity, and dividing the greater square by
the less, we obtain the ratio referred to. Calling the
specific heat at constant volume C<sup>v</sup>, and that at constant
pressure C<sup>p</sup>; calling, moreover, Newton’s calculated velocity
V, and the observed velocity V′, Laplace proved
that—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/mathtex1.jpg" width="73" height="38" alt="math." />
</div>

<p>Inserting the values of V and V′ in this equation,
and making the calculation, we find—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/mathtex2.jpg" width="78" height="34" alt="math." />
</div>

<p>Thus, without knowing either the specific heat at constant
volume or at constant pressure, Laplace found the
ratio of the greater of them to the less to be 1·42. It is
evident from the foregoing formulæ that the calculated
velocity of sound, multiplied by the square root of this
ratio, gives the observed velocity.</p>

<p>But there is one assumption connected with the determination
of this ratio, which must be here brought
clearly forth. It is assumed that the heat developed by
compression <em>remains in the condensed portion of the wave</em>,
and applies itself there to augment the elasticity; that no
portion of it is lost by radiation. If air were a powerful
radiator, this assumption could not stand. The heat developed
in the condensation could not then remain in the
condensation. It would radiate all round, lodging itself
for the most part in the chilled and rarefied portion of
the wave, which would be gifted with a proportionate
power of absorption. Hence the direct tendency of radiation
would be to equalize the temperatures of the differ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>ent
parts of the wave, and thus to abolish the increase
of velocity which called forth Laplace’s correction.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>


<h3>§ 11. <i>Mechanical Equivalent of Heat deduced from
Velocity of Sound</i></h3>

<p>The question, then, of the correctness of this ratio involves
the other and apparently incongruous question,
whether atmospheric air possesses any sensible radiative
power. If the ratio be correct, the practical absence of
radiative power on the part of air is demonstrated. How
then are we to ascertain whether the ratio is correct or
not? By a process of reasoning which illustrates still
further how natural agencies are intertwined. It was this
ratio, looked at by a man of genius, named Mayer, which
helped him to a clearer and a grander conception of the
relation and interaction of the forces of inorganic and
organic nature than any philosopher up to his time had
attained. Mayer was the first to see that the excess 0·42
of the specific heat at constant pressure over that at constant
volume was the quantity of heat consumed in the
work performed by the expanding gas. Assuming the
air to be confined laterally and to expand in a vertical
direction, in which direction it would simply have to lift
the weight of the atmosphere, he attempted to calculate
the precise amount of heat consumed in the raising of
this or any other weight. He thus sought to determine
the “mechanical equivalent” of heat. In the combination
of his data his mind was clear, but for the numerical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>correctness of these data he was obliged to rely upon the
experimenters of his age. Their results, though approximately
correct, were not so correct as the transcendent
experimental ability of Regnault, aided by the last refinements
of constructive skill, afterward made them. Without
changing in the slightest degree the method of his
thought or the structure of his calculation, the simple
introduction of the exact numerical data into the formula
of Mayer brings out the true mechanical equivalent of heat.</p>

<p>But how are we able to speak thus confidently of the
accuracy of this equivalent? We are enabled to do so
by the labors of an Englishman, who worked at this subject
contemporaneously with Mayer; and who, while animated
by the creative genius of his celebrated German
brother, enjoyed also the opportunity of bringing the inspirations
of that genius to the test of experiment. By
the immortal experiments of Mr. Joule, the mutual convertibility
of mechanical work and heat was first conclusively
established. And “Joule’s equivalent,” as it is
rightly called, considering the amount of resolute labor
and skill expended in its determination, is almost identical
with that derived from the formula of Mayer.</p>


<h3>§ 12. <i>Absence of Radiative Power of Air deduced from
Velocity of Sound</i></h3>

<p>Consider now the ground we have trodden, the curious
labyrinth of reasoning and experiment through which we
have passed. We started with the observed and calculated
velocities of sound in atmospheric air. We found
Laplace, by a special assumption, deducing from these
velocities the ratio of the specific heat of air at constant
pressure to its specific heat at constant volume. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
found Mayer calculating from this ratio the mechanical
equivalent of heat; finally, we found Joule determining
the same equivalent by direct experiments on the friction
of solids and liquids. And what is the result? Mr.
Joule’s experiments prove the result of Mayer to be the
true one; they therefore prove the ratio determined by
Laplace to be the true ratio; and, because they do this,
they prove at the same time the practical absence of radiative
power in atmospheric air. It seems a long step
from the stirring of water, or the rubbing together of
iron plates in Joule’s experiments, to the radiation of
the atoms of our atmosphere; both questions are, however,
connected by the line of reasoning here followed out.</p>

<p>But the true physical philosopher never rests content
with an inference when an experiment to verify or contravene
it is possible. The foregoing argument is clinched
by bringing the radiative power of atmospheric air to a
direct test. When this is done, experiment and reasoning
are found to agree; air being proved to be a body
sensibly devoid of radiative and absorptive power.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>But here the experimenter on the transmission of
sound through gases needs a word of warning. In Laplace’s
day, and long subsequently, it was thought that
gases of all kinds possessed only an infinitesimal power
of radiation; but that this is not the case is now well
established. It would be rash to assume that, in the case
of such bodies as ammonia, aqueous vapor, sulphurous
acid, and olefiant gas, their enormous radiative powers
do not interfere with the application of the formula of
Laplace. It behooves us to inquire whether the ratio
of the two specific heats deduced from the velocity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>sound in these bodies is the true ratio; and whether,
if the true ratio could be found by other methods, its
square root, multiplied into the calculated velocity, would
give the observed velocity. From the moment heat first
appears in the condensation and cold in the rarefaction
of a sonorous wave in any of those gases, the radiative
power comes into play to abolish the difference of temperature.
The condensed part of the wave is on this
account rendered more flaccid and the rarefied part less
flaccid than it would otherwise be, and with a sufficiently
high radiative power the velocity of sound, instead of
coinciding with that derived from the formula of Laplace,
must approximate to that derived from the more simple
formula of Newton.</p>


<h3>§ 13. <i>Velocity of Sound through Gases, Liquids, and Solids</i></h3>

<p>To complete our knowledge of the transmission of
sound through gases, a table is here added from the
excellent researches of Dulong, who employed in his
experiments a method which shall be subsequently
explained:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Velocity of Sound in Gases at the Temperature of 0° C.</span></p>

<table summary="Velocity of Sound in Gases"><tr>

<td class="tdl">Olefiant gas</td><td class="tdr">1,030</td><td class="tdc">”</td></tr></table>


<p>According to theory, the velocities of sound in oxygen
and hydrogen are inversely proportional to the square
roots of the densities of the two gases. We here find
this theoretic deduction verified by experiment. Oxygen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
being sixteen times heavier than hydrogen, the velocity
of sound in the latter gas ought, according to the above
law, to be four times its velocity in the former; hence, the
velocity in oxygen being 1,040, in hydrogen calculation
would make it 4,160. Experiment, we see, makes it 4,164.</p>

<p>The velocity of sound in liquids may be determined
theoretically, as Newton determined its velocity in air;
for the density of a liquid is easily determined, and its
elasticity can be measured by subjecting it to compression.
In the case of water, the calculated and the observed
velocities agree so closely as to prove that the
changes of temperature produced by a sound-wave in
water have no sensible influence upon the velocity. In a
series of memorable experiments in the Lake of Geneva,
MM. Colladon and Sturm determined the velocity of
sound through water, and made it 4,708 feet a second.
By a mode of experiment which you will subsequently
be able to comprehend, the late M. Wertheim determined

<p>We learn from this table that sound travels with
different velocities through different liquids; that a salt
dissolved in water augments the velocity, and that the
salt which produces the greatest augmentation is chloride
of calcium. The experiments also teach us that in water,
as in air, the velocity augments with the temperature.
At a temperature of 15° C., for example, the velocity in
Seine water is 4,714 feet, at 30° it is 5,013 feet, and at
60° 5,657 feet a second.</p>

<p>I have said that from the compressibility of a liquid,
determined by proper measurements, the velocity of sound
through the liquid may be deduced. Conversely, from
the velocity of sound in a liquid, the compressibility of
the liquid may be deduced. Wertheim compared a series
of compressibilities deduced from his experiments on
sound with a similar series obtained directly by M.
Grassi. The agreement of both, exhibited in the following
table, is a strong confirmation of the accuracy
of the method pursued by Wertheim:</p>

<p>The greater the resistance which a liquid offers to
compression, the more promptly and forcibly will it return
to its original volume after it has been compressed.
The less the compressibility, therefore, the
greater is the elasticity, and consequently, other things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
being equal, the greater the velocity of sound through
the liquid.</p>

<p>We have now to examine the transmission of sound
through solids. Here, as a general rule, the elasticity,
as compared with the density, is greater than in liquids,
and consequently the propagation of sound is more
rapid.</p>

<p>In the following table the velocity of sound through
various metals, as determined by Wertheim, is recorded:</p>

<p>As a general rule, the velocity of sound through metals
is diminished by augmented temperature; iron is, however,
a striking exception to this rule, but it is only
within certain limits an exception. While, for example,
a rise of temperature from 20° to 100° C. in the
case of copper causes the velocity to fall from 11,666
to 10,802, the same rise produces in the case of iron an
increase of velocity from 16,822 to 17,386. Between 100°
and 200°, however, we see that iron falls from the last
figure to 15,483. In iron, therefore, up to a certain
point, the elasticity is augmented by heat; beyond that
point it is lowered. Silver is also an example of the
same kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span></p>

<p>The difference of velocity in iron and in air may
be illustrated by the following instructive experiment:
Choose one of the longest horizontal bars employed for
fencing in Hyde Park; and let an assistant strike the
bar at one end while the ear of the observer is held
close to the bar at a considerable distance from the
point struck. Two sounds will reach the ear in succession;
the first being transmitted through the iron
and the second through the air. This effect was obtained
by M. Biot, in his experiments on the iron water-pipes
of Paris.</p>

<p>The transmission of sound through a solid depends
on the manner in which the molecules of the solid are
arranged. If the body be homogeneous and without
structure, sound is transmitted through it equally well
in all directions. But this is not the case when the
body, whether inorganic like a crystal or organic like a
tree, possesses a definite structure. This is also true of
other things than sound. Subjecting, for example, a
sphere of wood to the action of a magnet, it is not
equally affected in all directions. It is repelled by the
pole of the magnet, but it is most strongly repelled when
the force acts along the fibre. Heat also is conducted
with different facilities in different directions through
wood. It is most freely conducted along the fibre, and
it passes more freely across the ligneous layers than
along them. Wood, therefore, possesses <em>three unequal
axes</em> of calorific conduction. These, established by myself,
coincide with the axes of elasticity discovered by
Savart. MM. Wertheim and Chevandier have determined
the velocity of sound along these three axes and obtained
the following results:</p>

<h3>§ 14. <i>Hooke’s Anticipation of the Stethoscope</i></h3>

<p>I will conclude this lecture on the transmission of
sound through gases, liquids, and solids, by a quaint and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
beautiful extract from the writings of that admirable
thinker, Dr. Robert Hooke. It will be noticed that the
philosophy of the stethoscope is enunciated in the following
passage, and another could hardly be found which
illustrates so well that action of the scientific imagination
which, in all great investigators, is the precursor and
associate of experiment:</p>

<p>“There may also be a possibility,” writes Hooke, “of
discovering the internal motions and actions of bodies
by the sound they make. Who knows but that, as in a
watch, we may hear the beating of the balance, and the
running of the wheels, and the striking of the hammers,
and the grating of the teeth, and multitudes of other
noises; who knows, I say, but that it may be possible to
discover the motions of the internal parts of bodies,
whether animal, vegetable, or mineral, by the sound they
make; that one may discover the works performed in the
several offices and shops of a man’s body, and thereby
discover what instrument or engine is out of order, what
works are going on at several times, and lie still at
others, and the like; that in plants and vegetables one
might discover by the noise the pumps for raising the
juice, the valves for stopping it, and the rushing of it
out of one passage into another, and the like? I could
proceed further, but methinks I can hardly forbear to
blush when I consider how the most part of men will
look upon this: but, yet again, I have this encouragement,
not to think all these things utterly impossible,
though never so much derided by the generality of men,
and never so seemingly mad, foolish, and fantastic, that
as the thinking them impossible cannot much improve
my knowledge, so the believing them possible may, per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>haps,
be an occasion of taking notice of such things as
another would pass by without regard as useless. And
somewhat more of encouragement I have also from experience,
that I have been able to hear very plainly the
beating of a man’s heart, and it is common to hear the
motion of wind to and fro in the guts, and other small
vessels; the stopping of the lungs is easily discovered by
the wheezing, the stopping of the head by the humming
and whistling noises, the slipping to and fro of the
joints, in many cases, by crackling, and the like, as to the
working or motion of the parts one among another; methinks
I could receive encouragement from hearing the
hissing noise made by a corrosive menstruum in its operation,
the noise of fire in dissolving, of water in boiling,
of the parts of a bell after that its motion is grown quite
invisible as to the eye, for to me these motions and the
other seem only to differ <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">secundum magis minus</em>, and so
to their becoming sensible they require either that their
motions be increased, or that the organ be made more
nice and powerful to sensate and distinguish them.”</p>

<h3>NOTE ON THE DIFFRACTION OF SOUND</h3>

<p><small>The recent explosion of a powder-laden barge in the Regent’s Park produced
effects similar to those mentioned in § 7. The sound-wave bent round
houses and broke the windows at the back, the coalescence of different
portions of the wave at special points being marked by intensified local action.
Close to the place where the explosion occurred the unconsumed gunpowder
was in the wave, and, as a consequence, the dismantled gatekeeper’s lodge
was girdled all round by a black belt of carbon.</small></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span></p>

<h3>SUMMARY OF CHAPTER I</h3>

<p>The sound of an explosion is propagated as a wave
or pulse through the air.</p>

<p>This wave impinging upon the tympanic membrane
causes it to shiver, its tremors are transmitted to the
auditory nerve, and along the auditory nerve to the
brain, where it announces itself as sound.</p>

<p>A sonorous wave consists of two parts, in one of
which the air is condensed, and in the other rarefied.</p>

<p>The motion of the sonorous wave must not be confounded
with the motion of the particles which at any
moment form the wave. During the passage of the wave
every particle concerned in its transmission makes only a
small excursion to and fro.</p>

<p>The length of this excursion is called the <em>amplitude</em>
of the vibration.</p>

<p>Sound cannot pass through a vacuum.</p>

<p>A certain sharpness of shock, or rapidity of vibration,
is needed for the production of sonorous waves in air. It
is still more necessary in hydrogen, because the greater
mobility of this light gas tends to prevent the formation
of condensations and rarefactions.</p>

<p>Sound is in all respects reflected like light; it is also
refracted like light; and it may, like light, be condensed
by suitable lenses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<p>Sound is also diffracted, the sonorous wave bending
round obstacles; such obstacles, however, in part shade
off the sound.</p>

<p>Echoes are produced by the reflected waves of sound.</p>

<p>In regard to sound and the medium through which it
passes, four distinct things are to be borne in mind—intensity,
velocity, elasticity, and density.</p>

<p>The intensity is proportional to the square of the amplitude
as above defined.</p>

<p>It is also proportional to the square of the maximum
velocity of the vibrating air-particles.</p>

<p>When sound issues from a small body in free air, the
intensity diminishes as the square of the distance from
the body increases.</p>

<p>If the wave of sound be confined in a tube with a
smooth interior surface, it may be conveyed to great distances
without sensible loss of intensity.</p>

<p>The velocity of sound in air depends on the elasticity
of the air in relation to its density. The greater the elasticity
the swifter is the propagation; the greater the density
the slower is the propagation.</p>

<p>The velocity is directly proportional to the square
root of the elasticity; it is inversely proportional to the
square root of the density.</p>

<p>Hence, if elasticity and density vary in the same proportion,
the one will neutralize the other as regards the
velocity of sound.</p>

<p>That they do vary in the same proportion is proved
by the law of Boyle and Mariotte; hence the velocity
of sound in air is independent of the density of
the air.</p>

<p>But that this law shall hold good, it is necessary that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
the dense air and the rare air should have the same
temperature.</p>

<p>The intensity of a sound depends upon the density of
the air in which it is generated, but not on that of the
air in which it is heard.</p>

<p>The velocity of sound in air of the temperature 0° C.
is 1,090 feet a second; it augments nearly 2 feet for
every degree Centigrade added to its temperature.</p>

<p>Hence, given the velocity of sound in air, the temperature
of the air may be readily calculated.</p>

<p>The distance of a fired cannon or of a discharge of
lightning may be determined by observing the interval
which elapses between the flash and the sound.</p>

<p>From the foregoing, it is easy to see that if a row of
soldiers form a circle, and discharge their pieces all at
the same time, the sound will be heard as a single
discharge by a person occupying the centre of the
circle.</p>

<p>But if the men form a straight row, and if the observer
stand at one end of the row, the simultaneous discharge
of the men’s pieces will be prolonged to a kind
of roar.</p>

<p>A discharge of lightning along a lengthy cloud may
in this way produce the prolonged roll of thunder. The
roll of thunder, however, must in part at least be due to
echoes from the clouds.</p>

<p>The pupil will find no difficulty in referring many
common occurrences to the fact that sound requires a
sensible time to pass through any considerable length of
air. For example, the fall of the axe of a distant wood-cutter
is not simultaneous with the sound of the stroke.
A company of soldiers marching to music along a road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
cannot march in time, for the notes do not reach those
in front and those behind simultaneously.</p>

<p>In the condensed portion of a sonorous wave the air
is above, in the rarefied portion of the wave it is below,
its average temperature.</p>

<p>This change of temperature, produced by the passage
of the sound-wave itself, virtually augments the elasticity
of the air, and makes the velocity of sound about one-sixth
greater than it would be if there were no change of
temperature.</p>

<p>The velocity found by Newton, who did not take this
change of temperature into account, was 916 feet a second.</p>

<p>Laplace proved that by multiplying Newton’s velocity
by the square root of the ratio of the specific heat of air
at constant pressure to its specific heat at constant volume,
the actual or observed velocity is obtained.</p>

<p>Conversely, from a comparison of the calculated and
observed velocities, the ratio of the two specific heats
may be inferred.</p>

<p>The mechanical equivalent of heat may be deduced
from this ratio; it is found to be the same as that established
by direct experiment.</p>

<p>This coincidence leads to the conclusion that atmospheric
air is devoid of any sensible power to radiate
heat. Direct experiments on the radiative power of air
establish the same result.</p>

<p>The velocity of sound in water is more than four times
its velocity in air.</p>

<p>The velocity of sound in iron is seventeen times its
velocity in air.</p>

<p>The velocity of sound along the fibre of pine-wood is
ten times its velocity in air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span></p>

<p>The cause of this great superiority is that the elasticities
of the liquid, the metal, and the wood, as compared
with their respective densities, are vastly greater
than the elasticity of air in relation to its density.</p>

<p>The velocity of sound is dependent to some extent
upon molecular structure. In wood, for example, it is
conveyed with different degrees of rapidity in different
directions.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N OUR last chapter we considered the propagation
through air of a sound of momentary duration. We
have to-day to consider continuous sounds, and to
make ourselves in the first place acquainted with the
physical distinction between noise and music. As far as
sensation goes, everybody knows the difference between
these two things. But we have now to inquire into the
causes of sensation, and to make ourselves acquainted
with the condition of the external air which in one case
resolves itself into music and in another into noise.</p>

<p>We have already learned that what is loudness in our
sensations is outside of us nothing more than width of
swing, or <em>amplitude</em>, of the vibrating air-particles. Every
other real sonorous impression of which we are conscious
has its correlative without, as a mere form or state of the
atmosphere. Were our organs sharp enough to see the
motions of the air through which an agreeable voice is
passing, we might see stamped upon that air the condi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>tions
of motion on which the sweetness of the voice depends.
In ordinary conversation, also, the physical precedes
and arouses the psychical; the spoken language,
which is to give us pleasure or pain, which is to rouse
us to anger or soothe us to peace, existing for a time,
between us and the speaker, as a purely mechanical
condition of the intervening air.</p>

<p>Noise affects us as an irregular succession of shocks.
We are conscious while listening to it of a jolting and
jarring of the auditory nerve, while a musical sound
flows smoothly and without asperity or irregularity.
How is this smoothness secured? <em>By rendering the
impulses received by the tympanic membrane perfectly
periodic.</em> A periodic motion is one that repeats itself.
The motion of a common pendulum, for example,
is periodic, but its vibrations are far too sluggish
to excite sonorous waves. To produce a musical tone
we must have a body which vibrates with the unerring
regularity of the pendulum, but which can impart much
sharper and quicker shocks to the air.</p>

<p>Imagine the first of a series of pulses following each
other at regular intervals, impinging upon the tympanic
membrane. It is shaken by the shock; and a body once
shaken cannot come instantaneously to rest. The human
ear, indeed, is so constructed that the sonorous motion
vanishes with extreme rapidity, but its disappearance is
not instantaneous; and if the motion imparted to the
auditory nerve by each individual pulse of our series
continues until the arrival of its successor, the sound will
not cease at all. The effect of every shock will be renewed
before it vanishes, and the recurrent impulses will
link themselves together to a continuous musical sound.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
The pulses, on the contrary, which produce noise, are of
irregular strength and recurrence. The action of noise
upon the ear has been well compared to that of a flickering
light upon the eye, both being painful through the
sudden and abrupt changes which they impose upon
their respective nerves.</p>

<p>The only condition necessary to the production of a
musical sound is that the pulses should succeed each
other in the same interval of time. No matter what its
origin may be, if this condition be fulfilled the sound becomes
musical. If a watch, for example, could be caused
to tick with sufficient rapidity—say one hundred times a
second—the ticks would lose their individuality and
blend to a musical tone. And if the strokes of a
pigeon’s wings could be accomplished at the same rate,
the progress of the bird through the air would be accompanied
by music. In the humming-bird the necessary
rapidity is attained; and when we pass on from birds to
insects, where the vibrations are more rapid, we have a
musical note as the ordinary accompaniment of the insects’
flight.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> The puffs of a locomotive at starting follow
each other slowly at first, but they soon increase so
rapidly as to be almost incapable of being counted. If
this increase could continue up to fifty or sixty puffs
a second, the approach of the engine would be heralded
by an organ-peal of tremendous power.</p>


<h3>§ 2. <i>Musical Sounds produced by Taps</i></h3>

<p>Galileo produced a musical sound by passing a knife
over the edge of a piastre. The minute serration of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>coin indicated the periodic character of the motion, which
consisted of a succession of taps quick enough to produce
sonorous continuity. Every schoolboy knows how
to produce a note with his slate-pencil. I will not call it
<span class="figright225"><a name="f15" id="f15">
<img src="images/i_085.jpg" width="225" height="394" alt="Fig. 15." /></a>
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.</span></span>
</span>
musical, because this term is
usually associated with pleasure,
and the sound of the pencil
is not pleasant.</p>


<p>The production of a musical
sound by taps is usually effected
by causing the teeth of
a rotating wheel to strike in
quick succession against a card.
This was first illustrated by the
celebrated Robert Hooke,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> and
nearer our own day by the
eminent French experimenter
Savart. We will confine ourselves
to homelier modes of
illustration. This gyroscope is
an instrument consisting mainly
of a heavy brass ring, <i>d</i>, Fig. 15, loading the circumference
of a disk, through which and at right angles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>to its surface, passes a steel axis, delicately supported
at its two ends. By coiling a string round the axis,
and drawing it vigorously out, the ring is caused to spin
rapidly; and along with it rotates a small-toothed wheel,
w. On touching this wheel with the edge of a card <i>c</i>,
a musical sound of exceeding shrillness is produced. I
place my thumb for a moment against the ring; the
rapidity of its rotation is thereby diminished, and this
is instantly announced by a lowering of the pitch of the
note. By checking the motion still more, the pitch is
lowered still further. We are here made acquainted with
the important fact that the pitch of a note depends upon
the rapidity of its pulses.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> At the end of the experiment
you hear the separate taps of the teeth against the card,
their succession not being quick enough to produce that
continuous flow of sound which is the essence of music.
A screw with a milled head attached to a whirling table,
and caused to rotate, produces by its taps against a card
a note almost as clear and pure as that obtained from
the toothed wheel of the gyroscope.</p>

<p>The production of a musical sound by taps may also
be pleasantly illustrated in the following way: In this
vise are fixed vertically two pieces of sheet-lead, with
their horizontal edges a quarter of an inch apart. I lay
a bar of brass across them, permitting it to rest upon the
edges, and, tilting the bar a little, set it in oscillation like
a see-saw. After a time, if left to itself, it comes to rest.
But suppose the bar on touching the lead to be always
tilted upward by a force issuing from the lead itself, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>is plain that the vibrations would then be rendered permanent.
Now such a force is brought into play <em>when the
bar is heated</em>. On its then touching the lead the heat is
communicated, a sudden jutting upward of the lead at
the point of contact being the result. Hence an incessant
tilting of the bar from side to side, so long as it
continues sufficiently hot. Substituting for the brass bar
the heated fire-shovel shown in Fig. 16, the same effect
is produced.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_087.jpg" width="500" height="222" alt="Fig. 16." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.</span></div>
</div>

<p>In its descent upon the lead the bar taps it gently,
the taps being so slow that you may readily count them.
But a mass of metal differently shaped may be caused to
vibrate more briskly, and the taps to succeed each other
more rapidly. When such a heated <em>rocker</em>, <a href="#f17">Fig. 17</a>, is
placed upon a block of lead, the taps hasten to a loud
rattle. When, with the point of a file, the rocker is
pressed against the lead, the vibrations are rendered more
rapid, and the taps link themselves together to a deep
musical tone. A second rocker, which oscillates more
quickly than the last, produces music without any other
pressure than that due to its own weight. Pressing it,
however, with the file, the pitch rises, until a note of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
singular force and purity fills the room. Relaxing the
pressure, the pitch instantly falls; resuming the pressure,
it again rises; and thus by the alternation of the pressure
we obtain great variations of tone. Nor are such rockers
essential. Allowing one face of the clean, square end of
a heated poker to rest upon the block of lead, a rattle is
heard; causing another face to rest upon the block, a
clear musical note is obtained. The two faces have been
bevelled differently by a file, so as to secure different
rates of vibration.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> This curious effect was discovered
by Schwartz and Trevelyan.</p>

<h3>§ 3. <i>Musical Sounds produced by Puffs</i></h3>

<p>Prof. Robison was the first to produce a musical sound
by a quick succession of <em>puffs</em> of air. His device was the
first form of an instrument which will soon be introduced
to you under the name of the <em>siren</em>. Robison describes
his experiment in the following words: “A stop-cock was
so constructed that it opened and shut the passage of a
pipe 720 times in a second. The apparatus was fitted to
the pipe of a conduit leading from the bellows to the
wind-chest of an organ. The air was simply allowed to
pass gently along this pipe by the opening of the cock.
When this was repeated 720 times in a second, the sound
<em>g in alt</em> was most smoothly uttered, equal in sweetness to
a clear female voice. When the frequency was reduced
to 360, the sound was that of a clear but rather a harsh
man’s voice. The cock was now altered in such a manner
that it never shut the hole entirely, but left about
one-third of it open. When this was repeated 720 times
in a second, the sound was uncommonly smooth and
sweet. When reduced to 360, the sound was more mellow
than any man’s voice of the same pitch.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_089.jpg" width="325" height="147" alt="Fig. 18." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18.</span></div>
</div>

<p>But the difficulty of obtaining the necessary speed
renders another form of the experiment preferable. A
disk of Bristol board, <span class="smcap">B</span>, Fig. 18, twelve inches in diameter,
is perforated at equal intervals along a circle near its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
circumference. The disk, being strengthened by a backing
of tin, can be attached to a whirling table, and
caused to rotate rapidly. The individual holes then disappear,
blending themselves into a continuous shaded
circle. Immediately over this circle is placed a bent
tube, <i>m</i>, connected with a pair of acoustic bellows. The
disk is now motionless, the lower end of the tube being
immediately over one of the perforations of the disk. If,
therefore, the bellows be worked, the wind will pass from
<i>m</i> through the hole underneath. But if the disk be
turned a little, an unperforated portion of the disk comes
under the tube, the current of air being then intercepted.
As the disk is slowly turned, successive perforations are
brought under the tube, and whenever this occurs a puff
of air gets through. On rendering the rotation rapid, the
puffs succeed each other in very quick succession, producing
pulses in the air which blend to a continuous
musical note, audible to you all. Mark how the note
varies. When the whirling table is turned rapidly the
sound is shrill; when its motion is slackened the pitch
immediately falls. If instead of a single glass tube there
were two of them, as far apart as two of our orifices, so
that whenever the one tube stood over an orifice, the
other should stand over another, it is plain that if both
tubes were blown through, we should, on turning the
disk, get a puff through two holes at the same time.
The intensity of the sound would be thereby augmented,
but the pitch would remain unchanged. The two puffs
issuing at the same instant would act in concert, and
produce a greater effect than one upon the ear. And if
instead of two tubes we had ten of them, or better still,
if we had a tube for every orifice in the disk, the puffs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
from the entire series would all issue, and would be all
cut off at the same time. These puffs would produce a
note of far greater intensity than that obtained by the
alternate escape and interruption of the air from a single
tube. In the arrangement now before you, Fig. 19, there
are nine tubes through which the air is urged—through
nine apertures, therefore, puffs escape at once. On turning
the whirling table, and alternately increasing and relaxing
its speed, the sound rises and falls like the loud
wail of a changing wind.</p>

<h3>§ 4. <i>Musical Sounds produced by a Tuning-fork</i></h3>

<p>Various other means may be employed to throw the
air into a state of periodic motion. A stretched string
pulled aside and suddenly liberated imparts vibrations
to the air which succeed each other in perfectly regular
intervals. A tuning-fork does the same. When a bow
is drawn across the prongs of this tuning-fork, <a href="#f20">Fig. 20</a>,
the resin of the bow enables the hairs to grip the prong,
which is thus pulled aside. But the resistance of the
prong soon becomes too strong, and it starts suddenly
back; it is, however, immediately laid hold of again by
the bow, to start back once more as soon as its resistance
becomes great enough. This rhythmic process, continu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>ally
repeated during the passage of the bow, finally
throws the fork into a state of intense vibration, and
the result is a musical note. A person close at hand
could see the fork vibrating; a deaf person bringing his
hand sufficiently near would feel the shivering of the air.
Or causing its vibrating prong to touch a card, taps against
the card link themselves, as in the case of the gyroscope,
to a musical sound, the fork coming rapidly to rest. What
we call silence expresses this absence of motion.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="f20" id="f20">
<img src="images/i_092.jpg" width="400" height="248" alt="Fig. 20." /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 20.</span></div>
</div>

<p>When the tuning-fork is first excited the sound issues
from it with maximum loudness, becoming gradually
feebler as the fork continues to vibrate. A person close
to the fork can notice at the same time that the amplitude,
or space through which the prongs oscillate, becomes
gradually less and less. But the most expert ear
in this assembly can detect no change in the pitch of the
note. The lowering of the intensity of a note does not
therefore imply the lowering of its pitch. In fact, though
the amplitude changes, the rate of vibration remains the
same. Pitch and intensity must therefore be held distinctly
apart; the latter depends solely upon the amplitude,
the former solely upon the rapidity of vibration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span></p>

<p>This tuning-fork may be caused to write the story of
its own motion. Attached to the side of one of its
prongs, <span class="smcap">F</span>, Fig. 21, is a thin strip of sheet-copper which
tapers to a point. When the tuning-fork is excited it vibrates,
and the strip of metal accompanies it in its vibration.
The point of the strip being brought gently down
upon a piece of smoked glass, it moves to and fro over
the smoked surface, leaving a clear line behind. As long
as the hand is kept motionless, the point merely passes to
and fro over the same line; but it is plain that we have
only to draw the fork along the glass to produce a sinuous
line, Fig. 21.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_093.jpg" width="450" height="150" alt="Fig. 21." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 21.</span></div>
</div>

<p>When this process is repeated without exciting the
fork afresh, the depth of the indentations diminishes.
The sinuous line approximates more and more to a
straight one. This is the visual expression of decreasing
amplitude. When the sinuosities entirely disappear, the
amplitude has become zero, and the sound, which depends
upon the amplitude, ceases altogether.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="f22" id="f22">
<img src="images/i_094.jpg" width="500" height="248" alt="Fig. 22." /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.</span></div>
</div>

<p>To M. Lissajous we are indebted for a very beautiful
method of giving optical expression to the vibrations of
a tuning-fork. Attached to one of the prongs of a very
large fork is a small metallic mirror, <span class="smcap">F</span>, Fig. 22, the other
prong being loaded with a piece of metal to establish
equilibrium. Permitting a slender beam of intense light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
to fall upon the mirror, the beam is thrown back by reflection.
In my hands is held a small looking-glass,
which receives the reflected beam, and from which it is
again reflected to the screen, forming a small luminous
disk upon the white surface. The disk is perfectly motionless,
but the moment the fork is set in vibration the
reflected beam is tilted rapidly up and down, the disk
describing a band of light three feet long. The length
of the band depends on the amplitude of the vibration,
and you see it gradually shorten as the motion of the
fork is expended. It remains, however, a straight line
as long as the glass is held in a fixed position. But on
suddenly turning the glass so as to make the beam travel
from left to right over the screen, you observe the
straight line instantly resolved into a beautiful luminous
ripple <i>m n</i>. A luminous impression once made upon the
retina lingers there for the tenth of a second; if then the
time required to transfer the elongated image from side
to side of the screen be less than the tenth of a second,
the wavy line of light will occupy for a moment the
whole width of the screen. Instead of permitting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
beam from the lamp to issue through a single aperture,
it may be caused to issue through two apertures, about
half an inch asunder, thus projecting two disks of light,
one <em>above</em> the other, upon the screen. When the fork is
excited and the mirror turned, we have a brilliant double
sinuous line running over the dark surface, Fig. 23.
turning the diaphragm so as to place the two disks
<em>beside</em> each other, on exciting the fork and moving the
mirror we obtain a beautiful interlacing of the two sinuous
lines, Fig. 24.</p>

<h3>§ 5. <i>The Waves of Sound</i></h3>

<p>How are we to picture to ourselves the condition of
the air through which this musical sound is passing?
Imagine one of the prongs of the vibrating fork swiftly
advancing; it compresses the air immediately in front of
it, and when it retreats it leaves a partial vacuum behind,
the process being repeated by every subsequent
advance and retreat. The whole function of the tuning-fork
is to carve the air into these condensations and
rarefactions, and they, as they are formed, propagate
themselves in succession through the air. A condensation
with its associated rarefaction constitutes, as already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
stated, a sonorous wave. In water the length of a wave
is measured from crest to crest; while, in the case of
sound, the <em>wave-length</em> is the distance between two successive
condensations. The condensation of the sound-wave
corresponds to the crest, while the rarefaction of the
sound-wave corresponds to the <em>sinus</em>, or depression, of
the water-wave. Let the dark spaces, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, Fig. 25,
represent the condensations, and the light ones, <i>a′</i>, <i>b′</i>, <i>c′</i>,
<i>d′</i>, the rarefactions of the waves issuing from the fork
<span class="smcap">a b</span>: the wave-length would then be measured from <i>a</i> to
<i>b</i>, from <i>b</i> to <i>c</i>, or from <i>c</i> to <i>d</i>.</p>

<h3>§ 6. <i>Definition of Pitch: Determination of Rates of
Vibration</i></h3>

<p>When two notes from two distinct sources are of the
same pitch, their rates of vibration are the same. If, for
example, a string yield the same note as a tuning-fork, it
is because they vibrate with the same rapidity; and if a
fork yield the same note as the pipe of an organ or the
tongue of a concertina, it is because the vibrations of the
fork in the one case are executed in precisely the same
time as the vibrations of the column of air, or of the
tongue, in the other. The same holds good for the human
voice. If a string and a voice yield the same note,
it is because the vocal chords of the singer vibrate in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
the same time as the string vibrates. Is there any way
of determining the actual number of vibrations corresponding
to a musical note? Can we infer from the
pitch of a string, of an organ-pipe, of a tuning-fork, or
of the human voice, the number of waves which it sends
forth in a second? This very beautiful problem is capable
of the most complete solution.</p>


<h3>§ 7. <i>The Siren: Analysis of the Instrument</i></h3>

<p>By the rotation of a perforated pasteboard disk, it has
been proved to you that a musical sound is produced by
a quick succession of puffs. Had we any means of registering
the number of revolutions accomplished by that
disk in a minute, we should have in it a means of determining
the number of puffs per minute due to a note
of any determinate pitch. The disk, however, is but a
cheap substitute for a far more perfect apparatus, which
requires no whirling table, and which registers its own
rotations with the most perfect accuracy.</p>

<p>I will take the instrument asunder, so that you may
see its various parts. A brass tube, <i>t</i>, <a href="#f26">Fig. 26</a>, leads into
a round box, <span class="smcap">C</span>, closed at the top by a brass plate <i>a b</i>.
This plate is perforated with four series of holes, placed
along four concentric circles. The innermost series contains
8, the next 10, the next 12, and the outermost 16
orifices. When we blow into the tube <i>t</i>, the air escapes
through the orifices, and the problem now before us is to
convert these continuous currents into discontinuous puffs.
This is accomplished by means of a brass disk <i>d e</i>, also
perforated with 8, 10, 12, and 16 holes, at the same distances
from the centre and with the same intervals between
them as those in the top of the box <span class="smcap">C</span>. Through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
the centre of the disk passes a steel axis, the two ends
of which are smoothly bevelled off to points at <i>p</i> and <i>p′</i>.
My object now is to cause
this perforated disk to rotate
over the perforated top <i>a b</i> of the box <span class="smcap">C</span>. You will understand
how this is done by observing how the instrument
is put together.</p>

<table summary="Figs. 26, 27." border="0" width="100%"><tr>
<td class="tdc"><div class="figcenter"><a name="f26" id="f26">

</tr></table>

<p>In the centre of <i>a b</i>, Fig. 26, is a depression <i>x</i> sunk
in steel, smoothly polished and intended to receive the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
end <i>p′</i> of the axis. I place the end <i>p′</i> in this depression,
and, holding the axis upright, bring down upon its upper
end <i>p</i> a steel cap, finely polished within, which holds the
axis at the top, the pressure both at top and bottom
being so gentle, and the polish of the touching surfaces
so perfect, that the disk can rotate with an exceedingly
small amount of friction. At <i>c</i>, Fig. 27, is the cap which
fits on to the upper end of the axis <i>p p′</i>. In this figure
the disk <i>d e</i> is shown covering the top of the cylinder
<span class="smcap">C</span>. You may neglect for the present the wheel-work of
the figure. Turning the disk <i>d e</i> slowly round, its perforations
may be caused to coincide or not coincide with
those of the cylinder underneath. As the disk turns, its
orifices come alternately over the perforations of the
cylinder and over the spaces between the perforations.
Hence it is plain that if air were urged into <span class="smcap">C</span>, and if the
disk could be caused to rotate at the same time, we
should accomplish our object, and carve into puffs the
streams of air. In this beautiful instrument the disk is
caused to rotate by the very air currents which it renders
intermittent. This is done by the simple device of causing
the perforations to pass <em>obliquely</em> through the top of
the cylinder <span class="smcap">C</span>, and also obliquely, but oppositely inclined,
through the rotating disk <i>d e</i>. The air is thus
caused to issue from <span class="smcap">C</span>, not vertically, but in side currents,
which impinge against the disk and drive it round.
In this way, by its passage through the siren, the air is
molded into sonorous waves.</p>

<p>Another moment will make you acquainted with the
recording portion of the instrument. At the upper part
of the steel axis <i>p p′</i>, <a href="#f27">Fig. 27</a>, is a screw <i>s</i>, working into
a pair of toothed wheels (seen when the back of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
instrument is turned toward you). As the disk and its
axis turn, these wheels rotate.  In front you simply
<span class="figleft300">
<img src="images/i_100.jpg" width="300" height="260" alt="Fig. 28." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 28.</span></span>
</span>
see two graduated dials,
Fig. 28, each furnished
with an index like the
hand of a clock. These
indexes record the number
of revolutions executed by
the disk in any given time.
By pushing the button <i>a</i>
or <i>b</i> the wheel-work is
thrown into or out of action,
thus starting or suspending,
in a moment, the process of recording. Finally,
by the pins <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>p</i>, <a href="#f27">Fig. 27</a>, any series of orifices
in the top of the cylinder <span class="smcap">C</span> can be opened or closed
at pleasure. By pressing <i>m</i>, one series is opened; by
pressing <i>n</i>, another. By pressing two keys, two series
of orifices are opened; by pressing three keys, three
series; and by pressing all the keys, puffs are caused to
issue from the four series simultaneously. The perfect
instrument is now before you, and your knowledge of it
is complete.</p>



<p>This instrument received the name of siren from its
inventor, Cagniard de la Tour. The one now before you
is the siren as greatly improved by Dove. The pasteboard
siren, whose performance you have already heard,
was devised by Seebeck, who gave the instrument various
interesting forms, and executed with it many important
experiments. Let us now make the siren sing. By
pressing the key <i>m</i>, the outer series of apertures in the
cylinder <span class="smcap">C</span> is opened, and by working the bellows, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
air is caused to impinge against the disk. It begins to
rotate, and you hear a succession of puffs which follow
each other so slowly that they may be counted. But as
the motion augments, the puffs succeed each other with
increasing rapidity, and at length you hear a deep musical
note. As the velocity of rotation increases the note
rises in pitch; it is now very clear and full, and as the
air is urged more vigorously, it becomes so shrill as to
be painful. Here we have a further illustration of the
dependence of pitch on rapidity of vibration. I touch the
side of the disk and lower its speed; the pitch falls instantly.
Continuing the pressure the tone continues to
sink, ending in the discontinuous puffs with which it
began.</p>

<p>Were the blast sufficiently powerful and the siren
sufficiently free from friction, it might be urged to higher
and higher notes, until finally its sound would become
inaudible to human ears. This, however, would not
prove the absence of vibratory motion in the air; but
would rather show that our auditory apparatus is incompetent
to take up and translate into sound vibrations
whose rapidity exceeds a certain limit. The ear, as we
shall immediately learn, is in this respect similar to the
eye.</p>

<p>By means of this siren we can determine with extreme
accuracy the rapidity of vibration of any sonorous
body. It may be a vibrating string, an organ-pipe, a
reed, or the human voice. Operating delicately, we
might even determine from the hum of an insect the
number of times it flaps its wings in a second. I will
illustrate the subject by determining in your presence a
tuning-fork’s rapidity of vibration. From the acoustic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
bellows I urge the air through the siren, and, at the
same time, draw my bow across the fork. Both now
sound together, the tuning-fork yielding at present the
highest note. But the pitch of the siren gradually rises,
and at length you hear the “beats” so well known to
musicians, which indicate that the two notes are not wide
apart in pitch. These beats become slower and slower;
now they entirely vanish, both notes blending as it were
to a single stream of sound.</p>

<p>All this time the clockwork of the siren has remained
out of action. As the second-hand of a watch crosses
the number 60, the clockwork is set going by pushing
the button <i>a</i>. We will allow the disk to continue its
rotation for a minute, the tuning-fork being excited from
time to time to assure you that the unison is preserved.
The second-hand again approaches 60; as it passes that
number the clockwork is stopped by pushing the button
<i>b</i>; and then, recorded on the dials, we have the exact
number of revolutions performed by the disk. The number
is 1,440. But the series of holes open during the
experiment numbers 16; for every revolution, therefore,
we had 16 puffs of air, or 16 waves of sound. Multiplying
1,440 by 16, we obtain 23,040 as the number of
vibrations executed by the tuning-fork in a minute.
Dividing this by 60, we find the number of vibrations
executed in a second to be 384.</p>


<h3>§ 8. <i>Determination of Wave-lengths: Time of Vibration</i></h3>

<p>Having determined the rapidity of vibration, the
length of the corresponding sonorous wave is found
with the utmost facility. Imagine a tuning-fork vibrating
in free air. At the end of a second from the time it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
commenced its vibrations the foremost wave would have
reached a distance of 1,090 feet in air of the freezing
temperature. In the air of a room which has a temperature
of about 15° C., it would reach a distance of 1,120
in a second. In this distance, therefore, are embraced
384 sonorous waves. Dividing 1,120 by 384, we find the
length of each wave to be nearly 3 feet. Determining in
this way the rates of vibration of the four tuning-forks
now before you, we find them to be 256, 320, 384, and
512; these numbers corresponding to wave-lengths of 4
feet 4 inches, 3 feet 6 inches, 2 feet 11 inches, and 2 feet
2 inches respectively. The waves generated by a man’s
voice in common conversation are from 8 to 12 feet,
those of a woman’s voice are from 2 to 4 feet in length.
Hence a woman’s ordinary pitch in the lower sounds of
conversation is more than an octave above a man’s; in
the higher sounds it is two octaves.</p>

<p>And here it is important to note that by the term
vibrations is meant <em>complete ones</em>; and by the term sonorous
wave is meant a condensation and its associated
rarefaction. By a vibration an excursion <em>to and fro</em> of
the vibrating body is to be understood. Every wave
generated by such a vibration bends the tympanic membrane
once in and once out. These are the definitions
of a vibration and of a sonorous wave employed in England
and Germany. In France, however, a vibration
consists of an excursion of the vibrating body <em>in one
direction</em>, whether to or fro. The French vibrations,
therefore, are only the halves of ours, and we therefore
call them semi-vibrations. In all cases throughout
these chapters, when the word vibration is employed
without qualification, it refers to complete vibrations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span></p>

<p>During the time required by each of those sonorous
waves to pass entirely over a particle of air, that particle
accomplishes one complete vibration. It is at one moment
pushed forward into the condensation, while at the
next moment it is urged back into the rarefaction. The
time required by the particle to execute a complete oscillation
is, therefore, that required by the sonorous wave
<em>to move through a distance equal to its own length</em>. Supposing
the length of the wave to be eight feet, and the
velocity of sound in air of our present temperature to be
1,120 feet a second, the wave in question will pass over
its own length of air in, 1/140th of a second: this is the
time required by every air-particle that it passes to complete
an oscillation.</p>

<p>In air of a definite density and elasticity a certain
length of wave always corresponds to the same pitch.
But supposing the density or elasticity not to be uniform;
supposing, for example, the sonorous waves from
one of our tuning-forks to pass from cold to hot air:
an instant augmentation of the wave-length would occur,
without any change of pitch, for we should have no
change in the rapidity with which the waves would
reach the ear. Conversely with the same length of wave
the pitch would be higher in hot air than in cold, for
the succession of the waves would be quicker. In an
atmosphere of hydrogen, waves of a certain length would
produce a note nearly two octaves higher than waves of
the same length in air; for, in consequence of the greater
rapidity of propagation, the number of impulses received
in a given time in the one case would be nearly four
times the number received in the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<h3>§ 9. <i>Definition of an Octave</i></h3>

<p>Opening the innermost and outermost series of the
orifices of our siren, and sounding both of them, either
together or in succession, the musical ears present at once
detect the relationship of the two sounds. They notice
immediately that the sound which issues from the circle
of sixteen orifices is the octave of that which issues from
the circle of eight. But for every wave sent forth by the
latter, two waves are sent forth by the former. In this
way we prove that the physical meaning of the term
“octave” is, that it is a note produced by double the
number of vibrations of its fundamental. By multiplying
the vibrations of the octave by two, we obtain <em>its</em>
octave, and by a continued multiplication of this kind
we obtain a series of numbers answering to a series of
octaves. Starting, for example, from a fundamental note
of 100 vibrations, we should find, by this continual multiplication,
that a note five octaves above it would be
produced by 3,200 vibrations. Thus:</p>

<table class="table2" summary="vibrations"><tr>
<td class="tdr7">100</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fundamental note.</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdr7">2</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr>
<td>——</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdr7">200</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;1st octave.</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdr7">2</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr>
<td>——</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdr7">400</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;2d octave.</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdr7">2</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr>
<td>——</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdr7">800</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;3d octave.</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdr7">2</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr>
<td>——</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdr7">1600</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;4th octave.</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdr7">2</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr>
<td>——</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdr7">3200</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;5th octave.</td></tr></table>


<p>This result is more readily obtained by multiplying the
vibrations of the fundamental note by the fifth power of
two. In a subsequent chapter we shall return to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
question of musical intervals.  For our present purpose
it is only necessary to define an octave.</p>


<h3>§ 10. <i>Limits of the Ear; and of Musical Sounds</i></h3>

<p>The ear’s range of hearing is limited in both directions.
Savart fixed the lower limit at eight complete
vibrations a second; and to cause these slowly recurring
vibrations to link themselves together he was obliged to
employ shocks of great power. By means of a toothed
wheel and an associated counter, he fixed the upper limit
of hearing at 24,000 vibrations a second. Helmholtz has
recently fixed the lower limit at 16 vibrations, and the
higher at 38,000 vibrations, a second. By employing
very small tuning-forks, the late M. Depretz showed that
a sound corresponding to 38,000 vibrations a second is
audible.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> Starting from the note 16, and multiplying continually
by 2, or more compendiously raising 2 to the
11th power, and multiplying this by 16, we should find
that at 11 octaves above the fundamental note the number
of vibrations would be 32,768. Taking, therefore, the
limit assigned by Helmholtz, the entire range of the human
ear embraces about eleven octaves. But all the notes
comprised within these limits cannot be employed in
music. The practical range of musical sounds is comprised
between 40 and 4,000 vibrations a second, which
amounts, in round numbers, to seven octaves.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<p>The limits of hearing are different in different persons.
While endeavoring to estimate the pitch of certain sharp
sounds, Dr. Wollaston remarked in a friend a total insensibility
to the sound of a small organ-pipe, which, in respect
to acuteness, was far within the ordinary limits of
hearing. The sense of hearing of this person terminated
at a note four octaves above the middle E of the pianoforte.
The squeak of the bat, the sound of a cricket,
even the chirrup of the common house-sparrow, are unheard
by some people who for lower sounds possess a
sensitive ear. A difference of a single note is sometimes
sufficient to produce the change from sound to silence.
“The suddenness of the transition,” writes Wollaston,
“from perfect hearing to total want of perception, occasions
a degree of surprise which renders an experiment
of this kind with a series of small pipes among several
persons rather amusing. It is curious to observe the
change of feeling manifested by various individuals of
the party, in succession, as the sounds approach and pass
the limits of their hearing. Those who enjoy a temporary
triumph are often compelled, in their turn, to acknowledge
to how short a distance their little superiority
extends.” “Nothing can be more surprising,” writes Sir
John Herschel, “than to see two persons, neither of them
deaf, the one complaining of the penetrating shrillness of
a sound, while the other maintains there is no sound at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
all. Thus, while one person mentioned by Dr. Wollaston
could but just hear a note four octaves above the middle
E of the pianoforte, others have a distinct perception of
sounds full two octaves higher. The chirrup of the sparrow
is about the former limit; the cry of the bat about
an octave above it; and that of some insects probably
another octave.” In “The Glaciers of the Alps” I have
referred to a case of short auditory range, noticed by
myself in crossing the Wengern Alps in company with
a friend. The grass at each side of the path swarmed
with insects, which to me rent the air with their shrill
chirruping. My friend heard nothing of this, the insect-music
lying beyond his limit of audition.</p>


<h3>§ 11. <i>Drum of the Ear.  The Eustachian Tube</i></h3>

<p>Behind the tympanic membrane exists a cavity—the
drum of the ear—in part crossed by a series of bones,
and in part occupied by air. This cavity communicates
with the mouth by means of a duct called the Eustachian
tube. This tube is generally closed, the air-space behind
the tympanic membrane being thus shut off from the external
air. If, under these circumstances, the external air
becomes denser, it will press the tympanic membrane inward.
If, on the other hand, the air outside becomes
rarer, while the Eustachian tube remains closed, the membrane
will be pressed outward. Pain is felt in both cases,
and partial deafness is experienced. I once crossed the
Stelvio Pass by night in company with a friend who
complained of acute pain in the ears. On swallowing his
saliva the pain instantly disappeared. By the act of swallowing,
the Eustachian tube is opened, and thus equilibrium
is established between the external and internal pressure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span></p>

<p>It is possible to quench the sense of hearing of low
sounds by stopping the nose and mouth, and trying to
expand the chest, as in the act of inspiration. This
effort partially exhausts the space behind the tympanic
membrane, which is then thrown into a state of tension
by the pressure of the outward air. A similar deafness
to low sounds is produced when the nose and mouth are
stopped, and a strong effort is made to expire. In this
case air is forced through the Eustachian tube into the
drum of the ear, the tympanic membrane being distended
by the pressure of the internal air. The experiment may
be made in a railway carriage, when the low rumble will
vanish or be greatly enfeebled, while the sharper sounds
are heard with undiminished intensity. Dr. Wollaston
was expert in closing the Eustachian tube, and leaving
the space behind the tympanic membrane occupied by
either compressed or rarefied air. He was thus able to
cause his deafness to continue for any required time
without effort on his part, always, however, abolishing
it by the act of swallowing. A sudden concussion may
produce deafness by forcing air either into or out of the
drum of the ear, and this <em>may</em> account for a fact noticed
by myself in one of my Alpine rambles. In the summer
of 1858, jumping from a cliff on to what was supposed
to be a deep snowdrift, I came into rude collision with a
rock which the snow barely covered. The sound of the
wind, the rush of the glacier-torrents, and all the other
noises which a sunny day awakes upon the mountains,
instantly ceased. I could hardly hear the sound of my
guide’s voice. This deafness continued for half an hour;
at the end of which time the blowing of the nose opened,
I suppose, the Eustachian tube, and restored, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
quickness of magic, the innumerable murmurs which
filled the air around me.</p>

<p>Light, like sound, is excited by pulses or waves; and
lights of different colors, like sounds of different pitch,
are excited by different rates of vibration. But in its
width of perception the ear exceedingly transcends the
eye; for while the former ranges over eleven octaves, but
little more than a single octave is possible to the latter.
The quickest vibrations which strike the eye, as light,
have only about twice the rapidity of the slowest;<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>
whereas the quickest vibrations which strike the ear,
as a musical sound, have more than two thousand times
the rapidity of the slowest.</p>


<h3>§ 12. <i>Helmholtz’s Double Siren</i></h3>

<p>Prof. Dove, as we have seen, extended the utility of
the siren of Cagniard de la Tour, by providing it with
four series of orifices instead of one. By doubling all its
parts, Helmholtz has recently added vastly to the power
of the instrument. The double siren, as it is called, is
now before you, <a href="#f29">Fig. 29</a> (next page). It is composed of
two of Dove’s sirens, <span class="smcap">C</span> and <span class="smcap">C′</span>, one turned upside down.
You will recognize in the lower siren the instrument
with which you are already acquainted. The disks of
the two sirens have a common axis, so that when one
disk rotates the other rotates with it. As in the former
case, the number of revolutions is recorded by clockwork
(omitted in the figure). When air is urged through
the tube <i>t′</i> the upper siren alone sounds; when urged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a><br /><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>through <i>t</i>, the lower one only sounds; when it is urged
simultaneously through <i>t′</i> and <i>t</i>, both the sirens sound.
With this instrument, therefore, we are able to introduce
much more varied combinations than with the former
one. Helmholtz has also contrived a means by which
not only the disk of the upper siren, but the box <span class="smcap">C′</span>
above the disk, can be caused to rotate. This is effected
by a toothed wheel and pinion, turned by a handle. Underneath
the handle is a dial with an index, the use of
which will be subsequently illustrated.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="f29" id="f29">
<img src="images/i_111.jpg" width="400" height="635" alt="Fig. 29." /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 29.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Let us direct our attention for the present to the
upper siren. By means of an India-rubber tube, the orifice
<i>t′</i> is connected with an acoustic bellows, and air is
urged into <span class="smcap">C′</span>. Its disk turns round, and we obtain with
it all the results already obtained with Dove’s siren.
The pitch of the note is uniform. Turning the handle
above, so as to cause the orifices of the cylinder <span class="smcap">C′</span> to
<em>meet</em> those of the disk, the two sets of apertures pass
each other more rapidly than when the cylinder stood
still. An instant rise of pitch is the result. By reversing
the motion, the orifices are caused to pass each other
more slowly than when <span class="smcap">C′</span> is motionless, and in this case
you notice an instant fall of pitch when the handle is
turned. Thus, by imparting in quick alternation a right-handed
and left-handed motion to the handle, we obtain
successive rises and falls of pitch. An extremely instructive
effect of this kind may be observed at any railway
station on the passage of a rapid train. During its approach
the sonorous waves emitted by the whistle are
virtually shortened, a greater number of them being
crowded into the ear in a given time. During its retreat
we have a virtual lengthening of the sonorous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
waves. The consequence is, that, when approaching,
the whistle sounds a higher note, and when retreating
it sounds a lower note, than if the train were still.
A fall of pitch, therefore, is perceived as the train passes
the station.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> This is the basis of Doppler’s theory of the
colored stars. He supposes that all stars are white, but
that some of them are rapidly retreating from us, thereby
lengthening their luminiferous waves and becoming red.
Others are rapidly approaching us, thereby shortening
their waves, and becoming green or blue. The ingenuity
of this theory is extreme, but its correctness is more than
doubtful.</p>


<h3>§ 13. <i>Transmission of Musical Sounds by Liquids and Solids</i></h3>

<p>We have thus far occupied ourselves with the transmission
of musical sounds through air. They are also
transmitted by liquids and solids. When a tuning-fork
screwed into a little wooden foot vibrates, nobody, except
the persons closest to it, hears its sound. On dipping the
foot into a glass of water a musical sound is audible:
the vibrations having been transmitted through the water
to the air. The tube <span class="smcap">M N</span>, Fig. 30, three feet long, is set
upright upon a wooden tray <span class="smcap">A B</span>. The tube ends in a
funnel at the top, and is now filled with water to the
brim. The fork <span class="smcap">F</span> is thrown into vibration, and on dipping
its foot into the funnel at the top of the tube, a
musical sound swells out. I must so far forestall matters
as to remark that in this experiment the tray is the real
sounding body. It has been thrown into vibration by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>the fork, but the vibrations have been conveyed to the
tray <em>by the water</em>. Through the same medium vibrations
<span class="figleft250">
<img src="images/i_114.jpg" width="250" height="348" alt="Fig. 30." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 30.</span></span>
</span>
are communicated to
the auditory nerve,
the terminal filaments
of which are immersed
in a liquid:
substituting mercury
for water, a similar
result is obtained.</p>



<p>The siren has received
its name from
its capacity to sing
under water. A vessel
now in front of
the table is half filled
with water, in which
a siren is wholly immersed.
When a
cock is turned, the
water from the pipes
which supply the house forces itself through the instrument.
Its disk is now rotating, and a sound of rapidly
augmenting pitch issues from the vessel. The pitch rises
thus rapidly because the heavy and powerfully pressed
water soon drives the disk up to its maximum speed of
rotation. When the supply is lessened, the motion relaxes
and the pitch falls. Thus, by alternately opening
and closing the cock, the song of the siren is caused to
rise and fall in a wild and melancholy manner. You
would not consider such a sound likely to woo mariners
to their doom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span></p>

<p>The transmission of musical sounds through solid
bodies is also capable of easy and agreeable illustration.
Before you is a wooden rod, thirty feet long,
passing from the table through a window in the ceiling,
into the open air above. The lower end of the rod
rests upon a wooden tray, to which the musical vibrations
of a body applied to the upper end of the rod are
to be transferred. An assistant is above, with a tuning-fork
in his hand. He strikes the fork against a pad; it
vibrates, but you hear nothing. He now applies the stem
of the fork to the end of the rod, and instantly the
wooden tray upon the table is rendered musical. The
pitch of the sound, moreover, is exactly that of the tuning-fork;
the wood has been passive as regards pitch,
transmitting the precise vibrations imparted to it without
any alteration. With another fork a note of another
pitch is obtained. Thus fifty forks might be employed
instead of two, and 300 feet of wood instead of 30; the
rod would transmit the precise vibrations imparted to it,
and no other.</p>

<p>We are now prepared to appreciate an extremely
beautiful experiment, for which we are indebted to
Sir Charles Wheatstone. In a room underneath this,
and separated from it by two floors, is a piano. Through
the two floors passes a tin tube 2-1/2 inches in diameter,
and along the axis of this tube passes a rod of deal, the
end of which emerges from the floor in front of the lecture-table.
The rod is clasped by India-rubber bands,
which entirely close the tin tube. The lower end of the
rod rests upon the sound-board of the piano, its upper
end being exposed before you. An artist is at this moment
engaged at the instrument, but you hear no sound.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
When, however, a violin is placed upon the end of the
rod, the instrument becomes instantly musical, not, however,
with the vibrations of its own strings, but with
those of the piano. When the violin is removed, the
sound ceases; putting in its place a guitar, the music
revives. For the violin and guitar we may substitute
a plain wooden tray, which is also rendered musical.
Here, finally, is a harp, against the sound-board of which
the end of the deal rod is caused to press; every note of
the piano is reproduced before you. On lifting the harp
so as to break the connection with the piano, the sound
vanishes; but the moment the sound-board is caused to
press upon the rod the music is restored. The sound of
the piano so far resembles that of the harp that it is
hard to resist the impression that the music you hear
is that of the latter instrument. An uneducated person
might well believe that witchcraft or “spiritualism” is
concerned in the production of this music.</p>

<p>What a curious transference of action is here presented
to the mind! At the command of the musician’s
will, the fingers strike the keys; the hammers strike the
strings, by which the rude mechanical shock is converted
into tremors. The vibrations are communicated to the
sound-board of the piano. Upon that board rests the
end of the deal rod, thinned off to a sharp edge to make
it fit more easily between the wires. Through the edge,
and afterward along the rod, are poured with unfailing
precision the entangled pulsations produced by the shocks
of those ten agile fingers. To the sound-board of the
harp before you the rod faithfully delivers up the vibrations
of which it is the vehicle. This second sound-board
transfers the motion to the air, carving it and chasing it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
into forms so transcendently complicated that confusion
alone could be anticipated from the shock and jostle of
the sonorous waves. But the marvellous human ear accepts

<h3>SUMMARY OF CHAPTER II</h3>

<p>A musical sound is produced by sonorous shocks
which follow each other at regular intervals with a
sufficient rapidity of succession.</p>

<p>Noise is produced by an irregular succession of sonorous
shocks.</p>

<p>A musical sound may be produced by <em>taps</em> which rapidly
and regularly succeed each other. The taps of a
card against the cogs of a rotating wheel are usually
employed to illustrate this point.</p>

<p>A musical sound may also be produced by a succession
of <em>puffs</em>. The siren is an instrument by which such
puffs are generated.</p>

<p>The pitch of a musical note depends solely on the
number of vibrations concerned in its production. The
more rapid the vibrations, the higher the pitch.</p>

<p>By means of the siren the rate of vibration of any
sounding body may be determined. It is only necessary
to render the sound of the siren and that of the body
identical in pitch to maintain both sounds in unison for
a certain time, and to ascertain, by means of the counter
of the siren, how many puffs have issued from, the instrument
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
in that time. This number expresses the number
of vibrations executed by the sounding body.</p>

<p>When a body capable of emitting a musical sound—a
tuning-fork, for example—vibrates, it molds the surrounding
air into sonorous waves, each of which consists of a
condensation and a rarefaction.</p>

<p>The length of the sonorous wave is measured from
condensation to condensation, or from rarefaction to rarefaction.</p>

<p>The wave-length is found by dividing the velocity of
sound per second by the number of vibrations executed
by the sounding body in a second.</p>

<p>Thus a tuning-fork which vibrates 256 times in a second
produces in air of 15° C., where the velocity is 1,120
feet a second, waves 4 feet 4 inches long. While two
other forks, vibrating respectively 320 and 384 times a
second, generate waves 3 feet 6 inches, and 2 feet 11
inches long.</p>

<p>A vibration, as defined in England and Germany, comprises
a motion to <em>and</em> fro. It is a <em>complete</em> vibration.
In France, on the contrary, a vibration comprises a movement
to <em>or</em> fro. The French vibrations are with us semi-vibrations.</p>

<p>The time required by a particle of air over which a
sonorous wave passes to execute a complete vibration is
that required by the wave to move through a distance
equal to its own length.</p>

<p>The higher the temperature of the air, the longer is
the sonorous wave corresponding to any particular rate
of vibration. Given the wave-length and the rate of vibration,
we can readily deduce the temperature of the air.</p>

<p>The human ear is limited in its range of hearing mu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>sical
sounds. If the vibrations number less than 16 a
second, we are conscious only of the separate shocks.
If they exceed 38,000 a second, the consciousness of
sound ceases altogether. The range of the best ear covers
about 11 octaves, but an auditory range limited to
6 or 7 octaves is not uncommon.</p>

<p>The sounds available in music are produced by vibrations
comprised between the limits of 40 and 4,000 a second.
They embrace 7 octaves.</p>

<p>The range of the ear far transcends that of the eye,
which hardly exceeds an octave.</p>

<p>By means of the Eustachian tube, which is opened in
the act of swallowing, the pressure of the air on both
sides of the tympanic membrane is equalized.</p>

<p>By either condensing or rarefying the air behind the
tympanic membrane, deafness to sounds of low pitch may
be produced.</p>

<p>On the approach of a railway train the pitch of the
whistle is higher, on the retreat of the train the pitch is
lower, than it would be if the train were at rest.</p>

<p>Musical sounds are transmitted by liquids and solids.
Such sounds may be transferred from one room to another;
from the ground-floor to the garret of a house
of many stories, for example, the sound being unheard
in the rooms intervening between both, and rendered
audible only when the vibrations are communicated to
a suitable sound-board.</p>

<h3>§ 1. <i>Vibrations of Strings: Use of Sound-Boards</i></h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>E HAVE to begin our studies to-day with the
vibrations of strings or wires; to learn how
bodies of this form are rendered available as
sources of musical sounds, and to investigate the laws of
their vibrations.</p>

<p>To enable a musical string to vibrate <em>transversely</em>, or
at right angles to its length, it must be stretched between
two rigid points. Before you, Fig. 31 (next page),
is an instrument employed to stretch strings, and to render
their vibrations audible. From the pin <i>p</i>, to which
one end of it is firmly attached, a string passes across
the two bridges <span class="smcap">B</span> and <span class="smcap">B′</span>, being afterward carried over the
wheel <span class="smcap">H</span>, which moves with great freedom. The string is
finally stretched by a weight <span class="smcap">W</span>, of 28 lbs., attached to
its extremity. The bridges <span class="smcap">B</span> and <span class="smcap">B′</span>, which constitute
the real ends of the string, are fastened on to the long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
wooden box <span class="smcap">M N</span>.  The whole instrument is called a
monochord, or sonometer.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="f31" id="f31">
<img src="images/i_121.jpg" width="500" height="271" alt="Fig. 31." /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 31.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Taking hold of the stretched string <span class="smcap">B B′</span> at its middle
and plucking it aside, it springs back to its first position,
passes it, returns, and thus vibrates for a time to and
fro across its position of equilibrium. You hear a sound,
but the sonorous waves which at present strike your ears
do not proceed immediately from the string. The amount
of wave-motion generated by so thin a body is too
small to be sensible at any distance. But the string
is drawn tightly over the two bridges <span class="smcap">B B′</span>; and when
it vibrates, its tremors are communicated through these
bridges to the entire mass of the box <span class="smcap">M N</span>, and to the
air within the box, which thus become the real sounding
bodies.</p>



<p>That the vibrations of the string alone are not sufficient
to produce the sound may be thus experimentally
demonstrated: <span class="smcap">A B</span>, Fig. 32 (next page), is a piece of
wood placed across an iron bracket <span class="smcap">C</span>. From each end
of the piece of wood depends a rope ending in a loop,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
while stretching across from loop to loop is an iron bar
<i>m n</i>. From the middle of the iron bar hangs a steel
wire <i>s s′</i>, stretched by a weight <span class="smcap">W</span>, of 28 lbs. By this
<span class="figleft250">
<img src="images/i_122.jpg" width="250" height="604" alt="Fig. 32." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 32.</span></span>
</span>
arrangement the wire is detached
from all large surfaces
to which it could impart its
vibrations. Plucking the wire
<i>s s′</i>, it vibrates vigorously, but
even those nearest to it do not
hear any sound. The agitation
imparted to the air is too inconsiderable
to affect the auditory
nerve at any distance. A
second wire <i>t t′</i>, <a href="#f33">Fig. 33</a> (next
page), of the same length, thickness,
and material as <i>s s′</i>, has
one of its ends attached to the
wooden tray <span class="smcap">A B</span>. This wire also
carries a weight <span class="smcap">W</span>, of 28 lbs.
Finally, passing over the bridges
<span class="smcap">B B′</span> of the sonometer, <a href="#f31">Fig. 31</a>, is
our third wire, in every respect
like the two former, and, like
them, stretched by a weight <span class="smcap">W</span>,
of 28 lbs. When the wire <i>t t′</i>,
Fig. 33, is caused to vibrate,
you hear its sound distinctly.
Though one end only of the wire
is connected with the tray <span class="smcap">A B</span>, the vibrations transmitted
to it are sufficient to convert the tray into a sounding
body. Finally, when the wire of the sonometer <span class="smcap">M N</span>,
<a href="#f31">Fig. 31</a>, is plucked, the sound is loud and full, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
the instrument is specially constructed to take up the
vibrations of the wire.</p>

<p>The importance of employing proper sounding apparatus
in stringed instruments is rendered manifest by
<span class="figright250"><a name="f33" id="f33">
<img src="images/i_123.jpg" width="250" height="442" alt="Fig. 33." /></a>
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 33.</span></span>
</span>
these experiments. It
is not the strings of a
harp, or a lute, or a
piano, or a violin, that
throw the air into sonorous
vibrations. It is
the large surfaces with
which the strings are
associated, and the air
inclosed by these surfaces.
The goodness
of such instruments depends
almost wholly
upon the quality and
disposition of their
sound-boards.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>



<p>Take the violin as
an example. It is, or
ought to be, formed of
wood of the most perfect
elasticity. Imperfectly
elastic wood expends
the motion imparted
to it in the friction of its own molecules; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>motion is converted into heat, instead of sound. The
strings of the violin pass from the “tail-piece” of the
instrument over the “bridge,” being thence carried to
the “pegs,” the turning of which regulates the tension
of the strings. The bow is drawn across at a point about
one-tenth of the length of the string from the bridge.
The two “feet” of the bridge rest upon the most yielding
portion of the “belly” of the violin, that is, the portion
that lies between the two <i>f</i>-shaped orifices. One foot is
fixed over a short rod, the “sound post,” which runs
from belly to back through the interior of the violin.
This foot of the bridge is thereby rendered rigid, and it
is mainly through the other foot, which is not thus supported,
that the vibrations are conveyed to the wood of
the instrument, and thence to the air within and without.
The sonorous quality of the wood of a violin is
mellowed by age. The very act of playing also has a
beneficial influence, apparently constraining the molecules
<span class="figleft225"><a name="f34" id="f34">
<img src="images/i_124.jpg" width="225" height="174" alt="Fig. 34." /></a>
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 34.</span></span>
</span>
of the wood, which in the
first instance might be refractory,
to conform at last to the requirements
of the vibrating strings.</p>



<p>This is the place to make the
promised reference (page 38) to
Prof. Stokes’s explanation of
the action of sound-boards. Although
the amplitude of the vibrating board may be very
small, still its larger area renders the abolition of the
condensations and rarefactions difficult. The air cannot
move away in front nor slip in behind before it is sensibly
condensed and rarefied. Hence with such vibrating
bodies sound-waves may be generated, and loud tones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
produced, while the thin strings that set them in vibration,
acting alone, are quite inaudible.</p>

<p>The increase of sound, produced by the stoppage of
lateral motion, has been experimentally illustrated by
Prof. Stokes. Let the two black rectangles in <a href="#f33">Fig. 34</a>
represent the section of a tuning-fork. After it has been
made to vibrate, place a sheet of paper, or the blade of
a broad knife, with its edge parallel to the axis of the
fork, and as near to the fork as may be without touching.
If the obstacle be so placed that the section of it
is <span class="smcap">A</span> or <span class="smcap">B</span>, no effect is produced; but if it be placed at <span class="smcap">C</span>,
so as to prevent the reciprocating to-and-fro movement of
the air, which tends to abolish the condensations and
rarefactions, the sound becomes much stronger.</p>


<h3>§ 2. <i>Laws of Vibrating Strings</i></h3>

<p>Having thus learned how the vibrations of strings are
rendered available in music, we have next to investigate
the laws of such vibrations. I pluck at its middle point
the string <span class="smcap">B B′</span>, <a href="#f31">Fig. 31</a>. The sound heard is the fundamental
or lowest note of the string, to produce which it
swings, as a whole, to and fro. By placing a movable
bridge under the middle of the string, and pressing the
string against the bridge, it is divided into two equal
parts. Plucking either of those at its centre, a musical
note is obtained, which many of you recognize as the
octave of the fundamental note. In all cases, and with
all instruments, the octave of a note is produced by
doubling the number of its vibrations. It can, moreover,
be proved, both by theory and by the siren, that this
half string vibrates with exactly twice the rapidity of the
whole. In the same way it can be proved that one-third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
of the string vibrates with three times the rapidity, producing
a note a fifth above the octave, while one-fourth
of the string vibrates with four times the rapidity, producing
the double octave of the whole string. In general
terms, <em>the number of vibrations is inversely proportional
to the length of the string</em>.</p>

<p>Again, the more tightly a string is stretched the more
rapid is its vibration. When this comparatively slack
string is caused to vibrate, you hear its low fundamental
note. By turning a peg, round which one end of it is
coiled, the string is tightened, and the pitch rendered
higher. Taking hold with my left hand of the weight w,
attached to the wire <span class="smcap">B B′</span> of our sonometer, and plucking
the wire with the fingers of my right, I alternately press
upon the weight and lift it. The quick variations of
tension are expressed by a varying wailing tone. Now,
the number of vibrations executed in the unit of time
bears a definite relation to the stretching force. Applying
different weights to the end of the wire <span class="smcap">B B′</span>, and
determining in each case the number of vibrations executed
in a second, we find the numbers thus obtained to
be <em>proportional to the square roots of the stretching weights</em>.
A string, for example, stretched by a weight of one
pound, executes a certain number of vibrations per second;
if we wish to double this number, we must stretch
it by a weight of four pounds; if we wish to treble the
number, we must apply a weight of nine pounds, and
so on.</p>

<p>The vibrations of a string also depend upon its thickness.
Preserving the stretching weight, the length, and
the material of the string constant, <em>the number of vibrations
varies inversely as the thickness of the string</em>. If,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
therefore, of two strings of the same material, equally
long and equally stretched, the one has twice the diameter
of the other, the thinner string will execute double
the number of vibrations of its fellow in the same time.
If one string be three times as thick as another, the
latter will execute three times the number of vibrations,
and so on.</p>

<p>Finally, the vibrations of a string depend upon the
density of the matter of which it is composed. A platinum
wire and an iron wire, for example, of the same
length and thickness, stretched by the same weight, will
not vibrate with the same rapidity. For, while the specific
gravity of iron, or in other words its density, is 7·8,
that of platinum is 21·5. All other conditions remaining
the same, <em>the number of vibrations is inversely proportional
to the square root of the density of the string</em>. If the density
of one string, therefore, be one-fourth that of another
of the same length, thickness, and tension, it will execute
its vibrations twice as rapidly; if its density be one-ninth
that of the other, it will vibrate with three times the
rapidity, and so on. The last two laws, taken together,
may be expressed thus: <em>The number of vibrations is inversely
proportional to the square root of the weight of the
string</em>.</p>

<p>In the violin and other stringed instruments we avail
ourselves of thickness instead of length to obtain the
deeper tones. In the piano we not only augment the
thickness of the wires intended to produce the bass
notes, but we load them by coiling round them an extraneous
substance. They resemble horses heavily jockeyed,
and move more slowly on account of the greater
weight imposed upon the force of tension.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<h3>§ 3. <i>Mechanical Illustrations of Vibrations. Progressive and
Stationary Waves. Ventral Segments and Nodes</i></h3>

<p>These, then, are the four laws which regulate the
<em>transverse</em> vibrations of strings. We now turn to certain
allied phenomena, which, though they involve mechanical
<span class="figleft125">
<img src="images/i_128a.jpg" width="125" height="568" alt="Fig. 35." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 35.</span></span>
</span>
considerations of a rather complicated kind, may be completely mastered by an average
<span class="figright125">
<img src="images/i_128b.jpg" width="125" height="536" alt="Fig. 36." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 36.</span></span>
</span>
amount of attention. And they
<em>must</em> be mastered if we would
thoroughly comprehend the
philosophy of stringed instruments.</p>



<p>From the ceiling <i>c</i>, Fig. 35,
of this room hangs an India-rubber
tube twenty-eight feet
long. The tube is filled with
sand to render its motions slow
and more easily followed by the
eye. I take hold of its free end
<i>a</i>, stretch the tube a little, and
by properly timing my impulses
cause it to swing to and fro as a
whole, as shown in the figure.
It has its definite period of vibration
dependent on its length,
weight, thickness, and tension,
and my impulses must synchronize
with that period.</p>

<p>I now stop the motion, and by a sudden jerk raise a
hump upon the tube, which runs along it as a pulse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
toward its fixed end; here the hump reverses itself, and
runs back to my hand. At the fixed end of the tube, in
obedience to the law of reflection, the pulse reversed
both its position and the direction of its motion. Supposing
<i>c</i>, Fig. 36, to be the fixed end of the tube, and
<i>a</i> the end held in the hand: if the
pulse on reaching <i>c</i> have the position
shown in (1), after reflection it
will have the position shown in (2).
The arrows mark the direction of
progression. The time required for
the pulse to pass from the hand to
the fixed end and back is exactly
that required to accomplish one
complete vibration of the tube as a
whole. It is indeed the addition
of such impulses which causes the
tube to continue to vibrate as a
whole.</p>

<div class="figright200">
<img src="images/i_129.jpg" width="200" height="504" alt="Fig. 37." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 37.</span></div>
</div>

<p>If, instead of a single jerk, a
succession of jerks be imparted,
thereby sending a series of pulses
along the tube, every one of them
will be reflected above, and we
have now to inquire how the direct
and reflected pulses behave toward
each other.</p>

<p>Let the time required by the pulse to pass from my
hand to the fixed end be one second; at the end of half
a second it occupies the position <i>a b</i> (1), Fig. 37, its foremost
point having reached the middle of the tube. At
the end of a whole second it would have the position <i>b c</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
(2), its foremost point having reached the fixed end <i>c</i> of
the tube. At the moment when reflection begins at <i>c</i>, let
another jerk be imparted at <i>a</i>. The reflected pulse from
<i>c</i> moving with the same velocity as this direct one from
<i>a</i>, the foremost points of both will arrive at the centre <i>b</i>
(3) at the same moment. What must occur? The hump
<i>a b</i> wishes to move on to <i>c</i>, and to do so must move the
point <i>b</i> to the right. The hump <i>c b</i> wishes to move toward
<i>a</i>, and to do so must move the point <i>b</i> to the left.
The point <i>b</i>, urged by equal forces in two opposite directions
at the same time, will not move in either direction.
Under these circumstances, the two halves, <i>a b</i>, <i>b c</i> of
the tube will oscillate as if they were independent of
each other (4). Thus by the combination of two <em>progressive
pulses</em>, the one direct and the other reflected, we produce
two <em>stationary pulses</em> on the tube <i>a c</i>.</p>

<p>The vibrating parts <i>a b</i> and <i>b c</i> are called <em>ventral segments</em>;
the point of no vibration <i>b</i> is called a <em>node</em>.</p>

<p>The term “pulse” is here used advisedly, instead of
the more usual term <em>wave</em>. For a wave embraces two
of these pulses. It embraces both the hump and the depression
which follows the hump. The length of a wave,
therefore, is twice that of a ventral segment.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="f38" id="f38">
<img src="images/i_131.jpg" width="400" height="559" alt=">Fig. 38." /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 38.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Supposing the jerks to be so timed as to cause each
hump to be one-third of the tube’s length. At the end
of one-third of a second from starting the pulse will be
in the position <i>a b</i> (1), Fig. 38. In two-thirds of a second
it will have reached the position <i>b b′</i> (2), Fig. 38. At
this moment let a new pulse be started at <i>a</i>; after the
lapse of an entire second from the commencement we
shall have two humps upon the tube, one occupying the
position <i>a b</i> (3), the other the position <i>b′ c</i> (3). It is here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
manifest that the end of the reflected pulse from <i>c</i>, and
the end of the direct one from <i>a</i>, will reach the point <i>b′</i>
at the same moment. We shall therefore have the state
of things represented in (4), where <i>b b′</i> wishes to move
upward, and <i>c b′</i> to move downward. The action of both
upon the point <i>b′</i> being in opposite directions, that point
will remain fixed. <em>And from it, as if it were a fixed
point, the pulse b b′ will be reflected, while the segment b′ c
will oscillate as an independent string.</em> Supposing that at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
the moment <i>b b′</i> (4) begins to be reflected at <i>b′</i> we start
another pulse from <i>a</i>, it will reach <i>b</i> at the same moment
the pulse reflected from <i>b′</i> reaches it. The pulses will
neutralize each other at <i>b</i>, and we shall have there a
second node. Thus, by properly timing our jerks, we
divide the rope into three ventral segments, separated
from each other by two nodal points. As long as the
agitation continues the tube will vibrate as in (6).</p>

<p>There is no theoretic limit to the number of nodes
and ventral segments that may be thus produced. By
the quickening of the impulses, the tube is divided into
four ventral segments separated by three nodes; quickening
still more we have five ventral segments and four
nodes. With this particular tube the hand may be
caused to vibrate sufficiently quick to produce ten ventral
segments, as shown in <a href="#f38">Fig. 38 (7)</a>. When the stretching
force is constant, the number of ventral segments is
proportional to the rapidity of the hand’s vibration. To
produce 2, 3, 4, 10 ventral segments requires twice, three
times, four times, ten times the rapidity of vibration
necessary to make the tube swing as a whole. When the
vibration is very rapid the ventral segments appear like
a series of shadowy spindles, separated from each other
by dark motionless nodes. The experiment is a beautiful
one, and it is easily performed.</p>

<p>If, instead of moving the hand to-and fro, it be caused
to describe a small circle, the ventral segments become
“surfaces of revolution.” Instead of the hand, moreover,
we may employ a hook turned by a whirling-table. Before
you is a cord more rigid than the India-rubber
tube, 25 feet long, with one of its ends attached to a
freely-moving swivel fixed in the ceiling of the room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
By turning the whirling-table to which the other end is
attached, this cord may be divided into as many as 20
ventral segments, separated from each other by their appropriate
nodes. In another arrangement a string of catgut
12 feet long, with silvered beads strung along it, is
stretched horizontally between a vertical wheel and a free
swivel fixed in a rigid stand. On turning the wheel, and
properly regulating both the tension and the rapidity of
rotation, the beaded cord may be caused to rotate as a
whole, and to divide itself successively into 2, 3, 4, or 5
ventral segments. When we envelop the cord in a luminous
beam, every spot of light on every bead describes
a brilliant circle, and a very beautiful experiment is the
result.</p>


<h3>§ 4. <i>Mechanical Illustrations of Damping Various Points
of Vibrating Cord</i></h3>

<p>The subject of <em>stationary waves</em> was first experimentally
treated by the Messrs. Weber, in their excellent researches
on wave-motion. It is a subject which will well
repay your attention by rendering many of the most difficult
phenomena of musical strings perfectly intelligible.
It will make the connection of both classes of vibrations
more obvious if we vary our last experiments. Before
you is a piece of India-rubber tubing, 10 or 12 feet long,
stretched from <i>c</i> to <i>a</i>, Fig. 39, and made fast to two pins
at <i>c</i> and <i>a</i>. The tube is blackened, and behind it is
placed a surface of white paper, to render its motions
more visible. Encircling the tube at its centre <i>b</i> (1) by
the thumb and forefinger of my left hand, and taking
the middle of the lower half <i>b a</i> of the tube in my right,
I pluck it aside. Not only does the lower half swing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
but the upper half also is thrown into vibration. Withdrawing
the hands wholly from the tube, its two halves
<i>a b</i> and <i>b c</i> continue to vibrate, being separated from
each other by a node <i>b</i> at the centre (2).</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="f39" id="f39">
<img src="images/i_134.jpg" width="400" height="590" alt="Fig. 39." /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 39.</span></div>
</div>

<p>I now encircle the tube at a point <i>b</i> (3) one-third of
its length from its lower end <i>a</i>, and, taking hold of <i>a b</i>
at its centre, pluck it aside; the length <i>b c</i> above my
hand instantly divides into two vibrating segments.
Withdrawing the hands wholly, you see the entire
tube divided into three ventral segments, separated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
from each other by two motionless nodes, <i>b</i> and <i>b′</i>
(4). I pass on to the point <i>b</i> (5), which marks off
one-fourth of the length of the tube, encircle it, and
pluck the shorter segment aside. The longer segment
above my hand divides itself immediately into three
vibrating parts. So that, on withdrawing the hand, the
whole tube appears before you divided into four ventral
segments, separated from each other by three nodes <i>b b′ b″</i>
(6). In precisely the same way the tube may be divided
into five vibrating segments with four nodes.</p>

<p>This sudden division of the long upper segment of
the tube, without any apparent cause, is very surprising;
but if you grant me your attention for a moment, you
will find that these experiments are essentially similar to
those which illustrated the coalescence of direct and reflected
undulations. Reverting for a moment to the latter,
you observed that the to-and-fro motion of the hand
through the space of a single inch was sufficient to make
the middle points of the ventral segments vibrate through
a foot or eighteen inches. By being properly timed the
impulses accumulated, until the amplitude of the vibrating
segments exceeded immensely that of the hand which
produced them. The hand, in fact, constituted a nodal
point, so small was its comparative motion. Indeed, it is
usual, and correct, to regard the ends of the tube also as
nodal points.</p>

<p>Consider now the case represented in (1), <a href="#f39">Fig. 39</a>,
where the tube was encircled at its middle, the lower
segment <i>a b</i> being thrown into the vibration corresponding
to its length and tension. The circle formed by the
finger and thumb permitted the tube to oscillate at the
point <i>b</i> through the space of an inch; and the vibrations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
at that point acted upon the upper half <i>b c</i> exactly as
my hand acted when it caused the tube suspended from
the ceiling to swing as a whole, as in <a href="#f31">Fig. 35.</a> Instead
of the timid vibrations of the hand, we have now the
timid vibrations of the lower half of the tube; and these,
though narrowed to an inch at the place clasped by the
finger and thumb, soon accumulate, and finally produce
an amplitude, in the upper half, far exceeding their own.
The same reasoning applies to all the other cases of subdivision.
If, instead of encircling a point by the finger
and thumb, and plucking the portion of the tube below
it aside, that same point were taken hold of by the hand
and agitated in the period proper to the lower segment
of the tube, precisely the same effect would be produced.
We thus reduce both effects to one and the same cause;
namely, the combination of direct and reflected undulations.</p>

<p>And here let me add that, when the tube was divided
by the timid impulses of the hand, not one of its nodes
was, strictly speaking, a point of no motion; for were the
nodes not capable of vibrating through a very small amplitude,
the motion of the various segments of the tube
could not be maintained.</p>


<h3>§ 5. <i>Stationary Water-waves</i></h3>

<p>What is true of the undulations of an India-rubber
tube applies to all undulations whatsoever. Water-waves,
for example, obey the same laws, and the coalescence of
direct and reflected waves exhibits similar phenomena.
This long and narrow vessel with glass sides, Fig. 40, is
a copy of the wave-canal of the brothers Weber. It is
filled to the level <span class="smcap">A B</span> with colored water. By tilting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
end <span class="smcap">A</span> suddenly, a wave is generated, which moves on to
<span class="smcap">B</span>, and is there reflected. By sending forth fresh waves
at the proper intervals, the surface is divided into two
stationary undulations. Making the succession of impulses
more rapid we can subdivide the surface into
three, four (shown in the figure), or more stationary undulations,
separated from each other by nodes. The step
of a water-carrier is sometimes so timed as to throw the
surface of the water in his vessel into stationary waves,
which may augment in height until the water splashes
over the brim. Practice has taught the water-carrier
what to do; he changes his step, alters the period of
his impulses, and thus stops the accumulation of the
motion.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 40.</span></div>
</div>

<p>In travelling recently in the coupé of a French railway
carriage, I had occasion to place a bottle half filled
with water on one of the little coupé tables. It was
interesting to observe it. At times it would be quite
still; at times it would oscillate violently. To the passenger
within the carriage there was no sensible change
in the motion of the train to which the difference could
be ascribed. But in the one case the tremor of the carriage
contained no vibrations synchronous with the oscillating
period of the water, while in the other case such
vibrations were present. Out of the confused assemblage
of tremors the water selected the particular constituent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
which belonged to itself, and declared its presence when
the traveller was utterly unconscious of its introduction.</p>


<h3>§ 6. <i>Application of Mechanical Illustrations to
Musical Strings</i></h3>

<p>From these comparatively gross, but by no means
unbeautiful, mechanical vibrations, we pass to those of
a sounding string. In the experiments with our monochord,
when the wire was to be shortened, a movable
bridge was employed, against which the wire was pressed
so as to deprive the point resting on the bridge of all
possibility of motion. This strong pressure, however, is
not necessary. Placing the feather-end of a goose-quill
lightly against the middle of the string, and drawing a
violin-bow over one of its halves, the string yields the
octave of the note yielded by the whole string. The
mere <em>damping</em> of the string at the centre, by the light
touch of the feather, is sufficient to cause the string to
divide into two vibrating segments. Nor is it necessary
to hold the feather there throughout the experiment:
after having drawn the bow, the feather may be removed;
the string will continue to vibrate, emitting the
same note as before. We have here a case exactly analogous
to that in which the central point of our stretched
India-rubber tube was damped, by encircling it with the
finger and thumb as in <a href="#f39">Fig. 39 (1)</a>. Not only did the
half plucked aside vibrate, but the other half vibrated
also. We can, in fact, reproduce, with the vibrating
string, every effect obtained with the tube. This, however,
is a point of such importance as to demand full
experimental illustration.</p>

<p>To prove that when the centre is damped, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
bow drawn across one of the halves of the string, the
other half vibrates, I place across the middle of the untouched
half a little rider of red paper. Damping the
centre and drawing the bow, the string shivers, and
the rider is overthrown, Fig. 41.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_139a.jpg" width="500" height="201" alt="Fig. 41." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 41.</span></div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_139b.jpg" width="500" height="213" alt="Fig. 42." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 42.</span></div>
</div>

<p>When the string is damped at a point which cuts off
one-third of its length, and the bow drawn across the
shorter section, not only is this section thereby thrown
into vibration, but the longer section divides itself into
two ventral segments with a node between them. This
is proved by placing small riders of red paper on the
ventral segments, and a rider of blue paper at the node.
Passing the bow across the short segment you observe a
fluttering of the red riders, and now they are completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
tossed off, while the blue rider which crosses the node is
undisturbed, Fig. 42.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_140a.jpg" width="500" height="206" alt="Fig. 43." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 43.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Damping the string at the end of one-fourth of its
length, the bow is drawn across the shorter section; the
remaining three-fourths divide themselves into three ventral
segments, with two nodes between them. This is
proved by the unhorsing of the three riders placed
astride the ventral segments, the two at the nodes keeping
their places undisturbed, Fig. 43.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_140b.jpg" width="500" height="210" alt="Fig. 44." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 44.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Finally, damping the string at the end of one-fifth of
its length, and arranging, as before, the red riders on the
ventral segments and the blue ones on the nodes, by a
single sweep of the bow the four red riders are unhorsed,
and the three blue ones left undisturbed, Fig. 44. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
this way we perform with a sounding string the same
series of experiments that were formerly executed with
a stretched India-rubber tube, the results in both cases
being identical.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>To make, if possible, this identity still more evident
to you, a stout steel wire 28 feet in length is stretched
behind the table from side to side of the room. I take
the central point of this wire between my finger and
thumb, and allow my assistant to pluck one-half of it
aside. It vibrates, and the vibrations transmitted to the
other half are sufficiently powerful to toss into the air a
large sheet of paper placed astride the wire. With this
long wire, and with riders not of one-eighth of a square
inch, but of 30, 40, or 50 square inches in area, we may
repeat all the experiments which you have witnessed
with the musical string. The sheets of paper placed
across the nodes remain always in their places, while those
placed astride the ventral segments are tossed simultaneously
into the air when the shorter segment of the wire
is set in vibration. In this case, when close to it, you
can actually see the division of the wire.</p>


<h3>§ 7. <i>Melde’s Experiments</i></h3>

<p>It is now time to introduce to your notice some recent
experiments on vibrating strings, which appeal to the eye
with a beauty and a delicacy far surpassing anything
attainable with our monochord. To M. Melde, of Mar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>burg,
we are indebted for this new method of exhibiting
the vibrations of strings. The scale of the experiments
will be here modified so as to suit our circumstances.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_142.jpg" width="500" height="203" alt="Fig. 45." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 45.</span></div>
</div>

<p>First, then, you observe here a large tuning-fork <span class="smcap">T</span>,
Fig. 45, with a small screw fixed into the top of one of
its prongs, by which a silk string can be firmly attached
to the prong. From the fork the string passes round a
distant peg <span class="smcap">P</span>, by turning which it may be stretched to
any required extent. When the bow is drawn across the
fork, an irregular flutter of the string is the only result.
On tightening it, however, when at the proper tension it
expands into a beautiful gauzy spindle six feet long,
more than six inches across at its widest part, and
shining with a kind of pearly lustre. The stretching
force at the present moment is such that the string
swings to and fro as a whole, its vibrations being executed
in a vertical plane.</p>

<p>Relaxing the string gradually, when the proper tension
has been reached, it suddenly divides into two ventral
segments, separated from each other by a sharply-defined
and apparently motionless node.</p>

<p>While the fork continues vibrating, if the string be
relaxed still further, it divides into three vibrating parts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
Slackening it still more, it divides into four vibrating
parts. And thus we might continue to subdivide the
string into ten, or even twenty ventral segments, separated
from each other by the appropriate number of
nodes.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_143.jpg" width="350" height="254" alt="Fig. 46." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 46.</span></div>
</div>

<p>When white-silk strings vibrate thus, the nodes appear
perfectly fixed, while the ventral segments form
spindles of the most delicate beauty. Every protuberance
of the twisted string, moreover, writes its motion
in a more or less luminous line on the surface of the
aërial gauze. The four nodes of vibration just illustrated
are represented in Fig. 46, 1, 2, 3, 4.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span></p>
<p>When the synchronism between fork and string is
perfect, the vibrations of the string are steady and long-continued.
A slight departure from synchronism, however,
introduces unsteadiness, and the ventral segments,
though they may show themselves for a time, quickly
disappear.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_144.jpg" width="500" height="119" alt="Fig. 47." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 47.</span></div>
</div>

<p>In the experiments just executed the fork vibrated in
the direction of the length of the string. Every forward
stroke of the fork raised a protuberance, which ran to the
fixed end of the string, and was there reflected; so that
when the <em>longitudinal</em> impulses were properly timed they
produced a <em>transverse</em> vibration. Let us consider this
further. One end of this heavy cord is attached to a
hook A, Fig. 47, fixed in the wall. Laying hold of the
other end I stretch the cord horizontally, and then move
my hand to and fro in the direction of the cord. It
swings as a whole, and you may notice that always,
when the cord is at the limit of its swing, the hand is in
its most forward position. If it vibrate in a vertical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
plane, the hand, in order to time the impulses properly,
must be at its forward limit at the moment the cord
reaches the upper boundary, and also at the moment it
reaches the lower boundary of its excursion. A little
reflection will make it plain that, in order to accomplish
this, the hand must execute a complete vibration while
the cord executes a semi-vibration; in other words, the
vibrations of the hand must be twice as rapid as those of
the cord.</p>

<p>Precisely the same is true of our tuning-fork. When
the fork vibrates in the direction of the string, the number
of vibrations which it executes in a certain time is
twice the number executed by the string itself. And if,
while arranged thus, a fork and string vibrate with sufficient
rapidity to produce musical notes, the note of the
fork will be an octave above that of the string.</p>

<p>But if, instead of the hand being moved to and fro in
the direction of this heavy cord, it is moved at right
angles to that direction, then every upward movement
of the hand coincides with an upward movement of the
cord; every downward movement of the hand with a
downward movement of the cord. In fact, the vibrations
of hand and string, in this case, synchronize perfectly;
and if the hand could emit a musical note, the
cord would, emit a note of the same pitch. The same
holds good when a vibrating fork is substituted for the
vibrating hand.</p>

<p>Hence, if the string vibrate as a whole when the
vibrations of the fork are <em>along</em> it, it will divide into
two ventral segments when the vibrations are <em>across</em> it;
or, more generally expressed, preserving the tension constant,
whatever be the number of ventral segments pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>duced
by the fork when its vibrations are in the direction
of the string, twice that number will be produced when
the vibrations are transverse to the string. The string
<span class="smcap">A B</span>, for example, Figs. 48 and 49, passing over a pulley
<span class="smcap">B</span>, is stretched by a definite weight (not shown in the
figure). When the tuning-fork vibrates <em>along</em> it, as in
Fig. 48, the string divides into two equal ventral segments.
When the fork is turned so that it shall vibrate
at right angles to the string, the number of ventral segments
is four, Fig. 49, or double the former number.
Attaching two strings of the same length to the same
fork, the one parallel and the other perpendicular to the
direction of vibration, and stretching both with equal
weights, when the fork is caused to vibrate, one of them
divides itself into twice the number of ventral segments
exhibited by the other.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_146a.jpg" width="450" height="102" alt="Fig. 48." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 48.</span></div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_146b.jpg" width="450" height="103" alt="Fig. 49." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 49.</span></div>
</div>

<p>A number of exquisite effects may be obtained with
these vibrating cords. The path described by any point
of any one of them may be studied, after the manner of
Dr. Young, by illuminating that point, and watching the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
line of light which it describes. This is well illustrated
by a flat burnished silver wire, twisted so as to form a
spiral surface, from which, at regular intervals, the light
flashes when the wire is illuminated. When the vibration
is steady, the luminous spots describe straight lines
of sunlike brilliancy. On slackening the wire, but not so
much as to produce its next higher subdivision, upon the
larger motion of the wire are superposed a host of minor
motions, the combination of all producing scrolls of marvellous
complication and of indescribable splendor.</p>

<p>In reflecting on the best means of rendering these
effects visible, the thought occurred to me of employing
a fine platinum wire heated to redness by an electric current.
Such a wire now stretches from a tuning-fork over
a bridge of copper, and then passes round a peg. The
copper bridge on the one hand and the tuning-fork on
the other are the poles of a voltaic battery, from which
a current passes through the wire and causes it to glow.
On drawing the bow across the fork, the wire vibrates as
a whole; its two ends are brilliant, while its middle is
dark, being chilled by its rapid passage through the air.
Thus you have a shading off of incandescence from the
ends to the centre of the wire. On relaxing the tension,
the wire divides itself into two ventral segments; on relaxing
still further, we obtain three; still further, and the
wire divides into four ventral segments, separated from
each other by three brilliant nodes. Right and left from
every node the incandescence shades away until it disappears.
You notice also, when the wire settles into steady
vibration, that the nodes shine out with greater brilliancy
than that possessed by the wire before the vibration commenced.
The reason is this. Electricity passes more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
freely along a cold wire than along a hot one. When,
therefore, the vibrating segments are chilled by their
swift passage through the air, their conductivity is improved,
more electricity passes through the vibrating than
through the motionless wire, and hence the augmented
glow of the nodes. If, previous to the agitation of the
fork, the wire be at a bright-red heat, when it vibrates
its nodes may be raised to the temperature of fusion.</p>


<h3>§ 8. <i>New Mode of determining the Laws of Vibration</i></h3>

<p>We may extend the experiments of M. Melde to the
establishment of all the laws of vibrating strings. Here
are four tuning-forks, which we may call <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>,
whose rates of vibration are to each other as the numbers
1, 2, 4, 8. To the largest fork is attached a string,
<i>a</i>, stretched by a weight, which causes it to vibrate as a
whole. Keeping the stretching weight the same, I determine
the lengths of the same string, which, when attached
to the other three forks, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, swing as a whole.
The lengths in the four respective cases are as the numbers
8, 4, 2, 1.</p>

<p>From this follows the first law of vibration, already
established (p. 126) by another method; viz., <em>the length
of the string is inversely proportional to the rapidity of
vibration</em>.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<p>In this case the longest string vibrates as a whole
when attached to the fork <i>a</i>. I now transfer the string
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>to <i>b</i>, still keeping it stretched by the same weight. It
vibrates when <i>b</i> vibrates; but how? By dividing into
two equal ventral segments. In this way alone can it
accommodate itself to the swifter vibrating period of <i>b</i>.
Attached to <i>c</i>, the same string separates into four, while
when attached to <i>d</i>, it divides into eight ventral segments.
The number of the ventral segments is proportional
to the rapidity of vibration. It is evident that we
have here, in a more delicate form, a result which we
have already established in the case of our India-rubber
tube set in motion by the hand. It is also plain that this
result might be deduced theoretically from our first law.</p>

<p>We may extend the experiment. Here are two tuning-forks
separated from each other by the musical interval
called a fifth. Attaching a string to one of the forks, I
stretch the string until it divides into two ventral segments:
attached to the other fork, and stretched by the
same weight, it divides instantly into three segments
when the fork is set in vibration. Now, to form the
interval of a fifth, the vibrations of the one fork must
be to those of the other in the ratio of 2:3. The division
of the string, therefore, declares the interval. In,
the same way the division of the string in relation to
all other musical intervals may be illustrated.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>Again. Here are two tuning-forks, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, one of
which (<i>a</i>) vibrates twice as rapidly as the other. A
string of silk is attached to <i>a</i>, and stretched until it
synchronizes with the fork, and vibrates as a whole.
Here is a second string of the same length, formed by
laying four strands of the first one side by side. I attach
this compound thread to <i>b</i>, and, keeping the tension
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>the same as in the last experiment, set <i>b</i> in vibration.
The compound thread synchronizes with <i>b</i>, and swings as
a whole. Hence, as the fork <i>b</i> vibrates with half the
rapidity of <i>a</i>, by quadrupling the weight of the string
we halved its rapidity of vibration. In the same simple
way it might be proved that by augmenting the weight
of the string nine times we reduce the number of its
vibrations to one-third. We thus demonstrate the law:</p>

<p><i>The rapidity of vibration is inversely proportional to the
square root of the weight of the string.</i></p>

<p>An instructive confirmation of this result is thus obtained:
Attached to this tuning-fork is a silk string six
feet long. Two feet of the string are composed of four
strands of the single thread, placed side by side; the remaining
four feet are a single thread. A stretching force
is applied, which causes the string to divide into two
ventral segments. But how does it divide? Not at its
centre, as is the case when the string is of uniform thickness
throughout, but at the precise point where the thick
string terminates. This thick segment, two feet long, is
now vibrating at the same rate as the thin segment four
feet long, a result which follows by direct deduction from
the two laws already established.</p>

<p>Here again are two strings of the same length and
thickness. One of them is attached to the fork <i>a</i>, the
other to the fork <i>b</i>, which vibrates with twice the rapidity
of <i>a</i>. Stretched by a weight of 20 grains, the string
attached to <i>b</i> vibrates as a whole. Substituting <i>b</i> for <i>a</i>,
a weight of 80 grains causes the string to vibrate as a
whole. Hence, to double the rapidity of vibration, we
must quadruple the stretching weight. In the same way
it might be proved that to treble the rapidity of vibra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>tion
we should have to make the stretching weight ninefold.
Hence our third law:</p>

<p><i>The rapidity of vibration is proportional to the square
root of the tension.</i></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_151.jpg" width="500" height="540" alt="Fig. 50." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 50.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Let us vary this experiment. This silk cord is carried
from the tuning-fork over the pulley, and stretched by a
weight of 80 grains. The string vibrates as a whole as
at <span class="smcap">A</span>, Fig. 50. By diminishing the weight the string is
relaxed, and finally divides sharply into two ventral segments,
as at <span class="smcap">B</span>, Fig. 50. What is now the stretching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
weight?—20 grains, or one-fourth of the first. With a
stretching weight of almost exactly 9 grains it divides
into three segments, as at <span class="smcap">C</span>; while with a stretching
weight of 5 grains it divides into four segments, as at
<span class="smcap">D</span>. Thus then, a tension of one-fourth doubles, a tension
of one-ninth trebles, and a tension of one-sixteenth
quadruples the number of ventral segments. In general
terms, the number of segments is inversely proportional
to the square root of the tension. This result may be
deduced by reasoning from our first and third laws, and
its realization here confirms their correctness.</p>

<p>Thus, by a series of reasonings and experiments
totally different from those formerly employed, we arrive
at the self-same laws. In science, different lines of
reasoning often converge upon the same truth; and if we
only follow them faithfully, we are sure to reach that
truth at last. We may emerge, and often do emerge,
from our reasoning with a contradiction in our hands;
but on retracing our steps, we infallibly find the cause
of the contradiction to be due, not to any lack of constancy
in Nature, but of accuracy in man. It is the
millions of experiences of this kind which science furnishes
that give us our present faith in the stability of
Nature.</p>


<h3>HARMONIC SOUNDS OR OVERTONES</h3>

<h3>§ 9. <i>Timbre; Klangfarbe; Clang-tint</i></h3>

<p>We now approach a portion of our subject which will
subsequently prove to be of the very highest importance.
It has been shown by the most varied experiments that
a stretched string can either vibrate as a whole, or divide
itself into a number of equal parts, each of which vi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>brates
as an independent string. Now it is not possible
to sound the string as a whole without at the same time
causing, to a greater or less extent, its subdivision; that
is to say, superposed upon the vibrations of the whole
string we have always, in a greater or less degree, the
vibrations of its aliquot parts. The higher notes produced
by these latter vibrations are called the <em>harmonics</em>
of the string. And so it is with other sounding bodies;
we have in all cases a coexistence of vibrations. Higher
tones mingle with the fundamental one, and it is their
intermixture which determines what, for want of a better
term, we call the <em>quality</em> of the sound. The French call
it <em>timbre</em>, and the Germans call it <em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Klangfarbe</em>.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> It is this
union of high and low tones that enables us to distinguish
one musical instrument from another. A clarinet
and a violin, for example, though tuned to the same
fundamental note, are not confounded; the auxiliary
tones of the one are different from those of the other,
and these latter tones, uniting themselves to the fundamental
tones of the two instruments, destroy the identity
of the sounds.</p>

<p>All bodies and instruments, then, employed for producing
musical sounds emit, besides their fundamental
tones, others due to higher orders of vibration. The Germans
embrace all such sounds under the general term
<em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Obertöne</em>. I think it will be an advantage if we in England
adopt the term <em>overtones</em> as the equivalent of the
term employed in Germany. One has occasion to envy
the power of the German language to adapt itself to requirements
of this nature. The term <em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Klangfarbe</em>, for ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>ample,
employed by Helmholtz is exceedingly expressive,
and we need its equivalent also. Color depends upon
rapidity of vibration, blue light bearing to red the same
relation that a high tone does to a low one. A simple
color has but one rate of vibration, and it may be regarded
as the analogue of a simple tone in music. A
<em>tone</em>, then, may be defined as the product of a vibration
which cannot be decomposed into more simple ones. A
compound color, on the contrary, is produced by the admixture
of two or more simple ones, and an assemblage
of tones, such as we obtain when the fundamental tone
and the harmonics of a string sound together, is called
by the Germans a <em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Klang</em>. May we not employ the English
word <em>clang</em> to denote the same thing, and thus give
the term a precise scientific meaning akin to its popular
one? And may we not, like Helmholtz, add the word
<em>color</em> or <em>tint</em>, to denote the character of the clang, using
the term <em>clang-tint</em> as the equivalent of Klangfarbe?</p>

<p>With your permission I shall henceforth employ these
terms; and now it becomes our duty to look a little more
closely than we have hitherto done into the subdivision
of a string into its harmonic segments. Our monochord
with its stretched wire is before you. The scale of the
instrument is divided into 100 equal parts. At the middle
point of the wire stands the number 50; at a point
almost exactly one-third of its length from its end stands
the number 33; while at distances equal to one-fourth
and one-fifth of its length from its end stand the numbers
25 and 20 respectively. These numbers are sufficient
for our present purpose. When the wire is plucked at
50 you hear its clang, rather hollow and dull. When
plucked at 33, the clang is different. When plucked at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
25, the clang is different from either of the former. As
we retreat from the centre of the string, the clang-tint
becomes more “brilliant,” the sound more brisk and
sharp. What is the reason of these differences in the
sound of the same wire?</p>

<p>The celebrated Thomas Young, once professor in this
Institution, enables us to solve the question. He proved
that when any point of a string is plucked, all the higher
tones <em>which require that point for a node</em> vanish from the
clang. Let me illustrate this experimentally. I pluck
the point 50, and permit the string to sound. It may be
proved that the first overtone, which corresponds to a
division of the string into two vibrating parts, is now
absent from the clang. If it were present, the damping
of the point 50 would not interfere with it, for this point
would be its node. But on damping the point 50 the
fundamental tone is quenched, and no octave of that
tone is heard. Along with the octave its whole progeny
of overtones, with rates of vibration four times, six
times, eight times—all even numbers of times—the rate
of the fundamental tone, disappear from the clang. All
these tones require that a node should exist at the centre,
where, according to the principle of Young, it cannot
now be formed. Let us pluck some other point, say 25,
and damp 50 as before. The fundamental tone is now
gone, but its octave, clear and full, rings in your ears.
The point 50 in this case not being the one plucked, a
node can form there; it <em>has</em> formed, and the two halves
of the string continue to vibrate after the vibrations of
the string as a whole have been extinguished. Plucking
the point 33, the second harmonic or overtone is absent
from the clang. This is proved by damping the point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
33. If the second harmonic were on the string this
would not affect it, for 33 is its node. The fundamental
is quenched, but no tone corresponding to a division of
the string into three vibrating parts is now heard. The
tone is not heard because it was never there.</p>

<p>All the overtones which depend on this division,
those with six times, nine times, twelve times the rate
of vibration of the fundamental one, are also withdrawn
from the clang. Let us now pluck 20, damping 33 as
before. The second harmonic is not extinguished, but
continues to sound clearly and fully after the extinction
of the fundamental tone. In this case the point 33 not
being that plucked, a node can form there, and the string
can divide itself into three parts accordingly. In like
manner, if 25 be plucked and then damped, the third
harmonic is not heard; but when a point between 25
and the end of the wire is plucked, and the point 25
damped, the third harmonic is plainly heard. And thus
we might proceed, the general rule enunciated by Young,
and illustrated by these experiments, being, that when
any point of a string is plucked or struck, or, as Helmholtz
adds, agitated with a bow, the harmonic which requires
that point for a node vanishes from the general
clang of the string.</p>


<h3>§ 10. <i>Mingling of Overtones with Fundamental. The
Æolian Harp</i></h3>

<p>You are now in a condition to estimate the influence
which these higher vibrations must have upon the quality
of the tone emitted by the string. The sounds which
ring in your ears so plainly after the fundamental tone is
quenched mingled with that note before it was extin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>guished.
It seems strange that tones of such power
could be so masked by the fundamental one that even
the disciplined ear of a musician is unable to separate
the one from the other. But Helmholtz has shown that
this is due to want of practice and attention. The musician’s
faculties were never exercised in this direction.
There are numerous effects which the musician can distinguish,
because his art demands the habit of distinguishing
them. But it is no necessity of his art to resolve
the clang of an instrument into its constituent
tones. By attention, however, even the unaided ear can
accomplish this, particularly if the mind be informed
beforehand what the ear has to bend itself to find.</p>

<p>And this reminds me of an occurrence which took
place in this room at the beginning of my acquaintance
with Faraday. I wished to show him a peculiar action
of an electro-magnet upon a crystal. Everything was
arranged, when just before the magnet was excited he
laid his hand upon my arm and asked, “What am I to
look for?” Amid the assemblage of impressions connected
with an experiment, even this prince of experimenters
felt the advantage of having his attention directed
to the special point to be illustrated. Such help
is the more needed when we attempt to resolve into its
constituent parts an effect so intimately blended as the
composite tones of a clang. When we desire to isolate a
particular tone, one way of helping the attention is to
sound that tone feebly on a string of the proper length.
Thus prepared, the ear glides more readily from the
single tone to that of the same pitch in a composite
clang, and detaches it more readily from its companions.
In the experiments executed a moment ago, where our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
aim in each respective case was to bring out the higher
tone of the string in all its power, we entirely extinguished
its fundamental tone. It may, however, be enfeebled
without being destroyed. I pluck this string at
33, and lay the feather lightly for a moment on the
string at 50. The fundamental tone is thereby so much
lowered that its octave can make itself plainly heard.
By again touching the string at 50, the fundamental tone
is lowered still more; so that now its first harmonic is
more powerful than itself. You hear the sound of both,
and you might have heard them in the first instance by
a sufficient stretch of attention.</p>

<p>The harmonics of a string may be augmented or subdued
within wide limits. They may, as we have seen,
be masked by the fundamental tone, and they may also
effectually mask it. A stroke with a hard body is favorable,
while a stroke with a soft body is unfavorable
to their development. They depend, moreover, on the
promptness with which the body striking the string retreats
after striking. Thus they are influenced by the
weight and elasticity of the hammers in the pianoforte.
They also depend upon the place at which the shock is
imparted. When, for example, a string is struck in the
centre, the harmonics are less powerful than when it is
struck near one end.</p>

<p>Helmholtz, who is equally eminent as a mathematician
and as an experimental philosopher, has calculated the
theoretic intensity of the harmonics developed in various
ways; that is to say, the actual <em>vis viva</em> or energy of the
vibration, irrespective of its effects upon the ear. A
single example given by him will suffice to illustrate
this subject. Calling the intensity of the fundamental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
tone, in each case, 100, that of the second harmonic,
when the string was simply pulled aside at a point one-seventh
of its length from its end and then liberated,
was found to be 56·1, or a little better than one-half.
When the string was struck with the hammer of a pianoforte,
whose contact with the string endured for three-sevenths
of the period of vibration of the fundamental
tone, the intensity of the same tone was 9. In this case
the second harmonic was nearly quenched. When, however,
the duration of contact was diminished to three-twentieths
of the period of the fundamental, the intensity
of the harmonic rose to 357; while, when the string was
sharply struck with a very hard hammer, the intensity
mounted to 505, or to more than quintuple that of the
fundamental tone.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> Pianoforte manufacturers have found
that the most pleasing tone is excited by the middle
strings of their instruments, when the point against
which the hammer strikes is from one-seventh to one-ninth
of the length of the wire from its extremity.</p>

<p>Why should this be the case? Helmholtz has given
the answer. Up to the tones which require these points
as nodes the overtones all form chords with the fundamental;
but the sixth and eighth overtones of the wire
do not enter into such chords; they are dissonant tones,
and hence the desirability of doing away with them.
This is accomplished by making the point at which a
node is required that on which the hammer falls. The
possibility of the tone forming is thereby shut out, and
its injurious effect is avoided.</p>

<p>The strings of the Æolian harp are divided into harmonic
parts by a current of air passing over them. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>instrument is usually placed in a window between the
sash and frame, so as to leave no way open to the entrance
of the air except over the strings. Sir Charles
Wheatstone recommends the stretching of a first violin-string
at the bottom of a door which does not closely
fit. When the door is shut, the current of air entering
beneath sets the string in vibration, and when a fire is
in the room, the vibrations are so intense that a great
variety of sounds are simultaneously produced.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> A gentleman
in Basel once constructed with iron wires a large
instrument which he called the weather-harp or giant-harp,
and which, according to its maker, sounded as the
weather changed. Its sounds were also said to be evoked
by changes of terrestrial magnetism. Chladni pointed out
the error of these notions, and reduced the action of the
instrument to that of the wind upon its strings.</p>


<h3>§ 11. <i>Young’s Optical Illustrations</i></h3>

<p>Finally, with regard to the vibrations of a wire, the
experiments of Dr. Young, who was the first to employ
optical methods in such experiments, must be mentioned.
He allowed a sheet of sunlight to cross a pianoforte-wire,
and obtained thus a brilliant dot. Striking the wire he
caused it to vibrate, the dot described a luminous line
like that produced by the whirling of a burning coal in
the air, and the form of this line revealed the character
of the vibration. It was rendered manifest by these experiments
that the oscillations of the wire were not confined
to a single plane, but that it described in its vibra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>tions
curves of greater or less complexity. Superposed
upon the vibration of the whole string were partial vibrations,
which revealed themselves as loops and sinuosities.
Some of the lines observed by Dr. Young are given in
Fig. 51. Every one of these figures corresponds to a distinct
impression made by the wire upon the surrounding
air. The form of the sonorous wave is affected by these
superposed vibrations, and thus they influence the clang-tint
or quality of the sound.</p>

<h3>SUMMARY OF CHAPTER III</h3>

<p>The amount of motion communicated by a vibrating
string to the air is too small to be perceived as sound,
even at a small distance from the string.</p>

<p>When a broad surface vibrates in air, condensations
and rarefactions are more readily formed than when the
vibrating body is of small dimensions like a string.
Hence, when strings are employed as sources of musical
sounds, they are associated with surfaces of larger
area which take up their vibrations, and transfer them
to the surrounding air.</p>

<p>Thus the tone of a harp, a piano, a guitar, or a
violin, depends mainly upon the sound-board of the
instrument.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span></p>

<p>The following four laws regulate the vibrations of
strings: The rate of vibrations is inversely proportional
to the length; it is inversely proportional to the diameter;
it is directly proportional to the square root of the
stretching weight or tension; and it is inversely proportional
to the square root of the density of the
string.</p>

<p>When strings of different diameters and densities are
compared, the law is, that the rate of vibration is inversely
proportional to the square root of the weight
of the string.</p>

<p>When a stretched rope, or an India-rubber tube filled
with sand, with one of its ends attached to a fixed object,
receives a jerk at the other end, the protuberance
raised upon the tube runs along it as a pulse to the
fixed end, and, being there reflected, returns to the hand
by which the jerk was imparted.</p>

<p>The time required for the pulse to travel from the
hand to the fixed end of the tube and back is that
required by the whole tube to execute a complete
vibration.</p>

<p>When a series of pulses are sent in succession along
the tube, the direct and reflected pulses meet, and by
their coalescence divide the tube into a series of vibrating
parts, called <em>ventral segments</em>, which are separated from
each other by points of apparent rest called <em>nodes</em>.</p>

<p>The number of ventral segments is directly proportional
to the rate of vibration at the free end of the
tube.</p>

<p>The hand which produces these vibrations may move
through less than an inch of space; while by the accumulation
of its impulses the amplitude of the ventral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
segments may amount to several inches, or even to
several feet.</p>

<p>If an India-rubber tube, fixed at both ends, be encircled
at its centre by the finger and thumb, when either
of its halves is pulled aside and liberated, both halves
are thrown into a state of vibration.</p>

<p>If the tube be encircled at a point one-third, one-fourth,
or one-fifth of its length from one of its ends,
on pulling the shorter segment aside and liberating it,
the longer segment divides itself into two, three, or four
vibrating parts, separated from each other by nodes.</p>

<p>The number of vibrating segments depends upon the
rate of vibration at the point encircled by the finger and
thumb.</p>

<p>Here also the amplitude of vibration at the place encircled
by the finger and thumb may not be more than
a fraction of an inch, while the amplitude of the ventral
segments may amount to several inches.</p>

<p>A musical string damped by a feather at a point one-half,
one-third, one-fourth, one-fifth, etc., of its length
from one of its ends, and having its shorter segment
agitated, divides itself exactly like the India-rubber tube.
Its division may be rendered apparent by placing little
paper riders across it. Those placed at the ventral segments
are thrown off, while those placed at the nodes
retain their places.</p>

<p>The notes corresponding to the division of a string
into its aliquot parts are called the <em>harmonics</em> of the
string.</p>

<p>When a string vibrates as a whole, it usually divides
at the same time into its aliquot parts. Smaller vibrations
are superposed upon the larger; the tones corre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>sponding
to those smaller vibrations, and which we have
agreed to call overtones, mingling at the same time with
the fundamental tone of the string.</p>

<p>The addition of these overtones to the fundamental
tone determines the <em>timbre</em> or <em>quality</em> of the sound, or,
as we have agreed to call it, the <em>clang-tint</em>.</p>

<p>It is the addition of such overtones to fundamental
tones of the same pitch which enables us to distinguish
the sound of a clarionet from that of a flute, and the
sound of a violin from both. Could the pure fundamental
tones of these instruments be detached, they
would be indistinguishable from each other; but the
different admixture of overtones in the different instruments
renders their clang-tints diverse, and therefore
distinguishable.</p>

<p>Instead of the heavy India-rubber tube in the experiment
above referred to, we may employ light silk strings,
and, instead of the vibrating hand, we may employ vibrating
tuning-forks, and cause the strings to swing as
a whole, or to divide themselves into any number of
ventral segments. Effects of great beauty are thus obtained,
and by experiments of this character all the laws
of vibrating strings may be demonstrated.</p>

<p>When a stretched string is plucked aside or agitated
by a bow, all the overtones which require the agitated
point for a node vanish from the clang of the string.</p>

<p>The point struck by the hammer of the piano is from
one-seventh to one-ninth of the length of the string from
its end: by striking this point, the notes which require
it as a node cannot be produced, a source of dissonance
being thus avoided.</p>

<h3>§ 1. <i>Transverse Vibrations of a Rod fixed at Both Ends</i></h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_165.jpg" width="450" height="92" alt="Fig. 52." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 52.</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>UR last chapter was devoted to the transverse vibrations
of strings. This one I propose devoting
to the transverse vibrations of rods, plates, and
bells, commencing with the case of a rod fixed at both
ends.  Its modes of vibration are exactly those of a
string. It vibrates as a whole, and can also divide itself
into two, three, four, or more vibrating parts. But, for
a reason to be immediately assigned, the laws which
regulate the pitch of the successive notes are entirely
different in the two cases. Thus, when a string divides
into two equal parts, each of its halves vibrates with
twice the rapidity of the whole; while, in the case of the
rod, each of its halves vibrates with nearly three times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
the rapidity of the whole. With greater strictness, the
ratio of the two rates of vibration is as 9 is to 25, or as
the square of 3 to the square of 5. In Fig. 52, <i>a a′</i>, <i>c
c′</i>, <i>b b′</i>, <i>d d′</i>, are sketched the first four modes of vibration
of a rod fixed at both ends: the successive rates of
vibration, in the four cases bear to each other the following
relation:</p>

<table summary="four modes"><tr>
<td class="tdl">Number of nodes</td><td class="tdr padr1">0</td><td class="tdr padr1">1</td><td class="tdr padr1">2</td><td class="tdr padr1">3</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdl padr1">Number of vibrations</td><td class="tdr padr1">9</td><td class="tdr padr1">25</td><td class="tdr padr1">49</td><td class="tdr padr1">81</td></tr></table>

<p>the last row of figures being the squares of the odd numbers
3, 5, 7, 9.</p>

<p>In the case of a string, the vibrations are maintained
by a tension externally applied; in the case of a rod, the
vibrations are maintained by the elasticity of the rod
itself. The modes of division are in both cases the same,
but the forces brought into play are different, and hence
also the successive rates of vibration.</p>


<h3>§ 2. <i>Transverse Vibrations of a Rod fixed at One End</i></h3>

<p>Let us now pass on to the case of a rod fixed at one
end and free at the other. Here also it is the elasticity
of the material, and not any external tension, that sustains
the vibrations. Approaching, as usual, sonorous vibrations
through more grossly mechanical ones, I fix this
long rod of iron, <i>n o</i>, Fig. 53, in a vise, draw it aside,
and liberate it. To make its vibrations more evident, its
shadow is thrown upon a screen. The rod oscillates as a
whole to and fro, between the points <i>p p′</i>. But it is
capable of other modes of vibration. Damping it at the
point <i>a</i>, by holding it gently there between the finger
and thumb, and striking it sharply between <i>a</i> and <i>o</i>, the
rod divides into two vibrating parts, separated by a node<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
as shown in Fig. 54. You see upon the screen a shadowy
spindle between <i>a</i> and the vise below, and a shadowy
fan above <i>a</i>, with a black node between both. The
division may be effected without damping <i>a</i>, by merely
imparting a sufficiently sharp shock to the rod between
<i>a</i> and <i>o</i>. In this case, however, besides oscillating in
parts, the rod oscillates as a whole, the partial oscillations
being superposed upon the large one.</p>

<p>You notice, moreover, that the amplitude of the partial
oscillations depends upon the promptness of the
stroke. When the stroke is sluggish, the partial division
is but feebly pronounced, the whole oscillation being
most marked. But when the shock is sharp and prompt,
the whole oscillation is feeble, and the partial oscillations
are executed with vigor. If the vibrations of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
rod were rapid enough to produce a musical sound, the
oscillation of the rod as a whole would correspond to its
fundamental tone, while the division of the rod into two
vibrating parts would correspond to the first of its overtones.
If, moreover, the rod vibrated as a whole and as a
divided rod at the same time, the fundamental tone and
the overtone would be heard simultaneously. By damping
the proper point and imparting the proper shock, we can
still further subdivide the rod, as shown in Fig. 55.</p>


<h3>§ 3. <i>Chladni’s Tonometer: the Iron Fiddle, Musical Box,
and the Kaleidophone</i></h3>

<p>And now let us shorten our rod, so as to bring its
vibrations into proper relation to our ears. When it is
about four inches long, it emits a low musical sound.
When further shortened, the tone is higher; and, by continuing
to shorten the rod, the speed of vibration is augmented,
until finally the sound becomes painfully acute.
These musical vibrations differ only in rapidity from the
grosser oscillations which a moment ago appealed to the eye.</p>

<p>The increase in the rate of vibrations here observed is
ruled by a definite law; the number of vibrations executed
at a given time is inversely proportional to the
square of the length of the vibrating rod. You hear
the sound of this strip of brass, two inches long, as the
fiddle-bow is passed over its end. Making the length of
the strip one inch, the sound is the double octave of the
last one; the rate of vibration is augmented four times.
Thus, by doubling the length of the vibrating strip, we
reduce its rate of vibration to one-fourth; by trebling the
length, we reduce the rate of vibration to one-ninth; by
quadrupling the length, we reduce the vibrations to one-sixteenth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
and so on. It is plain that, by proceeding in
this way, we should finally reach a length where the vibrations
would be sufficiently slow to be counted. Or, it
is plain that, beginning with a long strip whose vibrations
could be counted, we might, by shortening, not
only make the strip sound, but also determine the rates
of vibration corresponding to its different tones. Supposing
we start with a strip 36 inches long, which vibrates
once in a second, the strip reduced to 12 inches
would, according to the above law, execute 9 vibrations
a second; reduced to 6 inches, it would execute 36, to 3
inches, 144; while, if reduced to 1 inch in length, it
would execute 1,296 vibrations in a second. It is easy
to fill the spaces between the lengths here given, and
thus to determine the rate of vibration corresponding to
any particular tone. This method was proposed and carried
out by Chladni.</p>

<p>A musical instrument may be formed of short rods.
Into this common wooden tray a number of pieces of
stout iron wire of different lengths are fixed, being
ranged in a semicircle. When the fiddle-bow is passed
over the series, we obtain a succession of very pleasing
notes. A competent performer could certainly extract
very tolerable music from a sufficient number of these
iron pins. The iron fiddle (<em>violon de fer</em>) is thus formed.
The notes of the ordinary musical box are also produced
by the vibrations of tongues of metal fixed at one end.
Pins are fixed in a revolving, cylinder, the free ends of
the tongues are lifted by these pins and then suddenly
let go. The tongues vibrate, their length and strength
being so arranged as to produce in each particular case
the proper rapidity of vibration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Charles Wheatstone has devised a simple and ingenious
optical method for the study of vibrating rods
fixed at one end. Attaching light glass beads, silvered
within, to the end of a metal rod, and allowing the light
of a lamp or candle to fall upon the bead, he obtained a
small spot intensely illuminated. When the rod vibrated,
this spot described a brilliant line which showed the
character of the vibration. A knitting-needle, fixed in a
vise with a small bead stuck on to it by marine glue,
answers perfectly as an illustration. In Wheatstone’s
more complete instrument, which he calls a kaleidophone,
the vibrating rods are firmly screwed into a
massive stand. Extremely beautiful figures are obtained
by this simple contrivance, some of which may now be
projected on a magnified scale upon the screen before you.</p>

<p>Fixing the rod horizontally in the vise, a condensed
beam is permitted to fall upon the silvered bead, a spot
of sunlike brilliancy being thus obtained. Placing a lens
in front of the bead, a bright image of the spot is
thrown upon the screen, the needle is then drawn aside,
and suddenly liberated. The spot describes a ribbon of
light, at first straight, but speedily opening out into an
ellipse, passing into a circle, and then again through a
second ellipse back to a straight line. This is due to the
fact that a rod held thus in a vise vibrates not only in
the direction in which it is drawn aside, but also at right
angles to this direction. The curve is due to the combination
of two rectangular vibrations.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> While the rod
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>is thus swinging as a whole, it may also divide itself into
vibrating parts. By properly drawing a violin-bow across
the needle, this serrated circle, Fig. 56, is obtained, a
number of small undulations being superposed upon the
large one. You moreover hear a musical tone, which you
did not hear when the rod vibrated as a whole only; its
oscillations, in fact, were then too slow to excite such a
tone. The vibrations which produce these sinuosities,
and which correspond to the first division of the rod, are
executed with about 6-1/4 times the rapidity of the vibrations
of the rod swinging as a whole. Again I draw the
bow; the note rises in pitch, the serrations run more
closely together, forming on the screen a luminous ripple
more minute and, if possible, more beautiful than the
last one, Fig. 57. Here we have the second division of
the rod, the sinuosities of which correspond to 17-13/36 times
its rate of vibration as a whole. Thus every change in
the sound of the rod is accompanied by a change of the
figure upon the screen.</p>

<p>The rate of vibration of the rod, as a whole, is to
the rate corresponding to its first division nearly as the
square of 2 is to the square of 5, or as 4:25. From the
first division onward the rates of vibration are approximately
proportional to the squares of the series of odd
numbers 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, etc. Supposing the vibrations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
the rod as a whole to number 36, then the vibrations
corresponding to this and to its successive divisions
would be expressed approximately by the following
series of number’s:</p>

<p class="center">36, 225, 625, 1225, 2025, etc.</p>

<p>In Fig. 58, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, are shown the modes of division
corresponding to this series of numbers. You will
not fail to observe that these overtones of a vibrating
rod rise far more rapidly in pitch than the harmonics of
a string.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 58.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Other forms of vibration may be obtained by smartly
striking the rod with the finger near its fixed end. In
fact, an almost infinite variety of luminous scrolls can be
thus produced, the beauty of which may be inferred from
the subjoined figures (see next page) first obtained by Sir
C. Wheatstone. They may be produced by illuminating
the bead with sunlight, or with the light of a lamp or
candle. The scrolls, moreover, may be doubled by employing
two candles instead of one. Two spots of light
then appear, each of which describes its own luminous
line when the knitting-needle is set in vibration. In a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>

Wheatstone’s application of his method to the study
of rectangular vibrations.</p>

<h3>§ 4. <i>Transverse Vibrations of a Rod free at Both Ends.
The Claque-bois and Glass Harmonica</i></h3>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="f60" id="f60">
<img src="images/i_174.jpg" width="400" height="145" alt="Fig. 60." /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 60.</span></div>
</div>

<p>From a rod or bar fixed at one end, we will now pass
to rods or bars free at both ends; for such an arrangement
has also been employed in music. By a method<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
afterward to be described, Chladni, the father of modern
acoustics, determined experimentally the modes of vibration
possible to such bars. The simplest mode of division
in this case occurs when the rod is divided by two
nodes into three vibrating parts. This division is easily
illustrated by a flexible box ruler, six feet long. Holding
it at about twelve inches from its two ends between
the forefinger and thumb of each hand, and shaking it,
or causing its centre to be struck, it vibrates, the middle
segment forming a shadowy spindle, and the two ends
forming fans. The shadow of the ruler on the screen
renders the mode of vibration very evident. In this case
the distance of each node from the end of the ruler is
about one-fourth of the distance between the two nodes.
In its second mode of vibration the rod or ruler is
divided into four vibrating parts by three nodes. In
<a href="#f60">Fig. 60</a>, 1 and 2, these respective modes of division are
shown. Looking at the edge of the ruler 1, the dotted
lines cutting <i>a a′</i>, <i>b b′</i>, show the manner in which the
segments bend up and down when the first division occurs,
while <i>c c′</i>, <i>d d′</i>, show the mode of vibration corresponding
to the second division. The deepest tone of a
rod free at both ends is higher than the deepest tone of
a rod fixed at one end in the proportion of 4:25. Be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>ginning
with the first two nodes, the rates of vibration
of the free bar rise in the following proportion:</p>

<table summary="proportions" border="0"><tr>
<td class="tdl padr1">Number of nodes</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdl">Numbers to the squares of which the</td><td rowspan="2"><big><big><big>}</big></big></big></td><td rowspan="2">3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdl">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pitch is approximately proportional</td></tr></table>

<p>Here, also, we have a similarly rapid rise of pitch to
that noticed in the last two cases.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_175.jpg" width="400" height="223" alt="Fig. 61." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 61.</span></div>
</div>

<p>For musical purposes the first division only of a free
rod has been employed. When bars of wood of different
lengths, widths, and depths, are strung along a cord
which passes through the nodes, we have the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">claque-bois</em>
of the French, an instrument now before you, <span class="smcap">A B</span>, Fig.
61. Supporting the cord at one end by a hook <i>k</i> and
holding it at the other in the left hand, I run the hammer
<i>h</i> along the series of bars, and produce an agreeable
succession of musical tones. Instead of using the cord,
the bars may rest at their nodes on cylinders of twisted
straw; hence the name “straw-fiddle,” sometimes applied
to this instrument. Chladni informs us that it is introduced
as a play of bells (Glockenspiel) into Mozart’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
opera of “Die Zauberflöte.” If, instead of bars of wood,
we employ strips of glass, we have the glass harmonica.</p>


<h3>§ 5. <i>Vibrations of a Tuning-fork</i></h3>

<p>From the vibrations of a bar free at both ends it is
easy to pass to the vibrations of a tuning-fork, as analyzed
by Chladni. Supposing <i>a a</i>, Fig. 62, to represent
a straight steel bar, with the nodal points corresponding
to its first mode of division marked by the transverse
dots. Let the bar be bent to the form <i>b b</i>; the two
nodal points still remain, but they have approached
nearer to each other. The tone of the bent bar is
also somewhat lower than that of the straight one.
Passing through various stages of bending, <i>c c</i>, <i>d d</i>,
we at length convert the bar into a tuning-fork <i>e e</i>, with
parallel prongs; it still retains its two nodal points,
which, however, are much closer together than when
the bar was straight.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_176a.jpg" width="250" height="177" alt="Fig. 62." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 62.</span></div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_176b.jpg" width="100" height="178" alt="Fig. 63." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 63.</span></div>
</div>

<p>When such a fork sounds its deepest note, its free
ends oscillate as in Fig. 63, where the prongs vibrate
between the limits <i>b</i> and <i>n</i>, and <i>f</i> and <i>m</i>, and where
<i>p</i> and <i>q</i> are the nodes. There is no division of a tuning-fork
corresponding to the division of a straight bar by
three nodes. In its second mode of division, which cor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>responds
to the first overtone of the fork, we have a
node on each prong, and two at the bottom. The principle
of Young, referred to at page 155, extends also to
tuning-forks. To free the fundamental tone from an overtone,
you draw your bow across the fork at the place
where the node is required to form the latter. In the
third mode of division there are two nodes on each
prong and one at the bottom; in the fourth division
there are two nodes on each prong and two at the bottom;
while in the fifth division there are three nodes
on each prong and one at the bottom. The first
overtone of the fork requires, according to Chladni,
6-1/4 times the number of vibrations of the fundamental
tone.</p>

<p>It is easy to elicit the overtones of tuning-forks.
Here, for example, is our old series, vibrating respectively
256, 320, 384, and 512 times in a second. In
passing from the fundamental tone to the first overtone
of each you notice that the interval is vastly greater than
that between the fundamental tone and the first overtone
of a stretched string. From the numbers just mentioned
we pass at once to 1,600, 2,000, 2,400, and 3,200
vibrations a second. Chladni’s numbers, however, though
approximately correct, are not always rigidly verified by
experiment. A pair of forks, for example, may have
their fundamental tones in perfect unison and their overtones
discordant. Two such forks are now before you.
When the fundamental tones of both are sounded, the
unison is perfect; but when the first overtones of both
are sounded, they are not in unison. You hear rapid
“beats,” which grate upon the ear. By loading one of
the forks with wax, the two overtones may be brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
into unison; but now the fundamental tones produce loud
beats when sounded together. This could not occur if
the first overtone of each fork was produced by a number
of vibrations exactly 6-1/4 times the rate of its fundamental.
In a series of forks examined by Helmholtz, the
number of vibrations of the first overtone varied from
5·6 to 6·6 times that of the fundamental.</p>

<p>Starting from the first overtone, and including it, the
rates of vibration of the whole series of overtones are as
the squares of the numbers 3, 5, 7, 9, etc. That is to
say, in the time required by the first overtone to execute
9 vibrations, the second executes 25, the third 49, the
fourth 81, and so on. Thus the overtones of the fork
rise with far greater rapidity than those of a string.
They also vanish more speedily, and hence adulterate
to a less extent the fundamental tone by their admixture.</p>


<h3>§ 6. <i>Chladni’s Figures</i></h3>

<p>The device of Chladni for rendering these sonorous
vibrations visible has been of immense importance to the
science of acoustics. Lichtenberg had made the experiment
of scattering an electrified powder over an electrified
resin-cake, the arrangement of the powder revealing
the electric condition of the surface. This experiment
suggested to Chladni the idea of rendering sonorous vibrations
visible by means of sand strewed upon the surface
of the vibrating body. Chladni’s own account of
his discovery is of sufficient interest to justify its introduction
here:</p>

<p>“As an admirer of music, the elements of which I had
begun to learn rather late, that is, in my nineteenth year,
I noticed that the science of acoustics was more neglected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
than most other portions of physics. This excited in me
the desire to make good the defect, and by new discovery
to render some service to this part of science. In
1785 I had observed that a plate of glass or metal gave
different sounds when it was struck at different places,
but I could nowhere find any information regarding the
corresponding modes of vibration. At this time there
appeared in the journals some notices of an instrument
made in Italy by the Abbé Mazzochi, consisting of bells,
to which one or two violin-bows were applied. This suggested
to me the idea of employing a violin-bow to examine
the vibrations of different sonorous bodies. When
I applied the bow to a round plate of glass fixed at its
middle it gave different sounds, which, compared with
each other, were (as regards the number of their vibrations)
equal to the squares of 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.; but the nature
of the motions to which these sounds corresponded,
and the means of producing each of them at will, were
yet unknown to me. The experiments on the electric
figures formed on a plate of resin, discovered and published
by Lichtenberg, in the memoirs of the Royal Society
of Göttingen, made me presume that the different
vibratory motions of a sonorous plate might also present
different appearances, if a little sand or some other similar
substance were spread over the surface. On employing
this means, the first figure that presented itself to my
eyes upon the circular plate already mentioned resembled
a star with ten or twelve rays, and the very acute sound,
in the series alluded to, was that which agreed with the
square of the number of diametrical lines.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span></p>

<h3>§ 7. <i>Vibrations of Square Plates: Nodal Lines</i></h3>

<p>I will now illustrate the experiments of Chladni, commencing
with a square plate of glass held by a suitable
clamp at its centre. The plate might be held with the
finger and thumb, if they could only reach far enough.
Scattering fine sand over the plate, the middle point of
one of its edges is damped by touching it with the
finger-nail, and a bow is drawn across the edge of the
plate, near one of its corners. The sand is tossed away
from certain parts of the surface, and collects along two
<em>nodal lines</em> which divide the large square into four
smaller ones, as in Fig. 64. This division of the
plate corresponds to its deepest tone.</p>

<table summary="division of the plate" border="0"><tr>

</div></td></tr></table>

<p>The signs + and - employed in these figures denote
that the two squares on which they occur are always
moving in opposite directions. When the squares marked
+ are above the average level of the plate those marked
- are below it; and when those marked - are above the
average level those marked + are below it. The nodal
lines mark the boundaries of these opposing motions.
They are the places of transition from the one motion
to the other, and are therefore unaffected by either.</p>

<p>Scattering sand once more over its surface, I damp
one of the corners of the plate, and excite it by drawing
the bow across the middle of one of its sides. The sand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
dances over the surface, and finally ranges itself in two
sharply-defined ridges along its diagonals, Fig. 65. The
note here produced is a fifth above the last. Again
damping two other points, and drawing the bow across
the centre of the opposite side of the plate, we obtain a
far shriller note than in either of the former cases, and
the manner in which the plate vibrates to produce this
note is represented in Fig. 66.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 67.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Thus far plates of glass have been employed held by
a clamp at the centre. Plates of metal are still more suitable
for such experiments. Here is a plate of brass, 12
inches square, and supported on a suitable stand. Damping
it with the finger and thumb of my left hand at two
points of its edge, and drawing the bow with my right
across a vibrating portion of the opposite edge, the complicated
pattern represented in Fig. 67 is obtained.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 68.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The beautiful series of patterns shown on page 182
were obtained by Chladni, by damping and exciting
square plates in different ways. It is not only interesting
but startling to see the suddenness with which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a><br /><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>these sharply-defined figures are formed by the sweep
of the bow of a skilful experimenter.</p>


<h3>§ 8. <i>Wheatstone’s Analysis of the Vibrations of
Square Plates</i></h3>



<p>And now let us look a little more closely into the
mechanism of these vibrations. The manner in which
a bar free at both ends divides itself when it vibrates
transversely has been already explained. Rectangular
pieces of glass or of sheet metal—the glass strips of
<span class="figright150">
<img src="images/i_183.jpg" width="150" height="119" alt="Fig. 69." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 69.</span></span></span>
the harmonica, for example—also obey
the laws of free rods and bars. In
Fig. 69 is drawn a rectangle <i>a</i>, with
the nodes corresponding to its first
division marked upon it, and underneath
it is placed a figure showing the
manner in which the rectangle, looked at edgewise, bends
up and down when it is set in vibration.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> For the sake
of plainness the bending is greatly exaggerated. The figures
<i>b</i> and <i>c</i> indicate that the vibrating parts of the plate
alternately rise above and fall below the average level
of the plate. At one moment, for example, the centre of
the plate is above the level and its ends below it, as at
<i>b</i>; while at the next moment its centre is below and its
two ends above the average level, as at <i>c</i>. The vibrations
of the plate consist in the quick successive assumption
of these two positions. Similar remarks apply to all
other modes of division.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span></p>
<p>Now suppose the rectangle gradually to widen, till it
becomes a square. There then would be no reason why
the nodal lines should form parallel to one pair of sides
rather than to the other. Let us now examine what
would be the effect of the coalescence of two such systems
of vibrations.</p>

<p>To keep your conceptions clear, take two squares of
glass and draw upon each of them the nodal lines belonging
to a rectangle. Draw the lines on one plate
in white, and on the other in black; this will help you
to keep the plates distinct in your mind as you look at
them. Now lay one square upon the other so that their
nodal lines shall coincide, and then realize with perfect
mental clearness both plates in a state of vibration. Let
us assume, in the first instance, that the vibrations of the
two plates are concurrent; that the middle segment and
the end segments of each rise and fall together; and now
suppose the vibrations of one plate transferred to the
other. What would be the result? Evidently vibrations
of a double amplitude on the part of the plate which has
received this accession. But suppose the vibrations of
the two plates, instead of being concurrent, to be in
exact opposition to each other—that when the middle
segment of the one rises the middle segment of the other
falls—what would be the consequence of adding them
together? Evidently a neutralization of all vibration.</p>

<p>Instead of placing the plates so that their nodal lines
coincide, set these lines at right angles to each other.
That is to say, push <span class="smcap">A</span> over <span class="smcap">A′</span>, <a href="#f70">Fig. 70</a>. In these figures
the letter <span class="smcap">P</span> means positive, indicating, in the section
where it occurs, a motion of the plate upward; while <span class="smcap">N</span>
means negative, indicating, where it occurs, a motion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
downward. You have now before you a kind of check
pattern, as shown in the third square, consisting of a
square <i>s</i> in the middle, a smaller square <i>b</i> at each corner,
and four rectangles at the middle portions of the four
sides. Let the plates vibrate, and let the vibrations of
their corresponding sections be concurrent, as indicated
by the letters <span class="smcap">P</span> and <span class="smcap">N</span>; and then suppose the vibrations
of one of them transferred to the other. What must result?
A moment’s reflection will show you that the big
middle square <i>s</i> will vibrate with augmented energy; the
same is true of the four smaller squares <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, at the
four corners; but you will at once convince yourselves
that the vibrations in the four rectangles are in opposition,
and that where their amplitudes are equal they will
destroy each other. The middle point of each side of the
plate of glass would therefore be a point of rest; the points
where the nodal lines of the two plates cross each other
would also be points of rest. Draw a line through every
three of these points and you will obtain a second square
inscribed in the first. The sides of this square are lines
of no motion.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="f70" id="f70">
<img src="images/i_185.jpg" width="450" height="157" alt="Fig. 70." /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 70.</span></div>
</div>

<p>We have thus far been theorizing. Let us now clip a
square plate of glass at a point near the centre of one of
its edges, and draw the bow across the adjacent corner of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
the plate. When the glass is homogeneous, a close approximation
to this inscribed square is obtained. The
reason is that when the plate is agitated in this manner
the two sets of vibrations which we have been considering
actually coexist in the plate, and produce the figure
due to their combination.</p>

<p>Again, place the squares of glass one upon the other
exactly as in the last case; but now, instead of supposing
them to concur in their vibrations, let their corresponding
sections oppose each other: that is, let <span class="smcap">A</span> cover <span class="smcap">A′</span>,
Fig. 71. Then it is manifest that on superposing the vibrations
the middle point of our middle square must be
a point of rest; for here the vibrations are equal and opposite.
The intersections of the nodal lines are also
points of rest, and so also is every corner of the plate
itself, for here the added vibrations are also equal and
opposite. We have thus fixed four points of rest on
each diagonal of the square. Draw the diagonals, and
they will represent the nodal lines consequent on the
superposition of the two vibrations.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_186.jpg" width="450" height="153" alt="Fig. 71." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 71.</span></div>
</div>

<p>These two systems actually coexist in the same plate
when the centre is clamped and one of the corners
touched, while the fiddle-bow is drawn across the middle
of one of the sides. In this case the sand which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
marks the lines of rest arranges itself along the diagonals.
This, in its simplest possible form, is Sir C. Wheatstone’s
analysis of these superposed vibrations.</p>


<h3>§ 9. <i>Vibrations of Circular Plates</i></h3>

<p>Passing from square plates to round ones, we also
obtain various beautiful effects. This disk of brass is
supported horizontally upon an upright stand: it is blackened,
and fine white sand is scattered lightly over it.
The disk is capable of dividing itself in various ways,
and of emitting notes of various pitch. I sound the lowest
fundamental note of the disk by touching its edge at
a certain point and drawing the bow across the edge at a
point 45° distant from the damped one. You hear the
note and you see the sand. It quits the four quadrants
of the disk, and ranges itself along two of the diameters,
Fig. 72, <span class="smcap">A</span> (next page). When a disk divides itself thus
into four vibrating segments, it sounds its deepest note.
I stop the vibration, clear the disk, and once more scatter
sand over it. Damping its edge, and drawing the bow
across it at a point 30° distant from the damped one, the
sand immediately arranges itself in a star. We have here
six vibrating segments, separated from each other by
their appropriate nodal lines, Fig. 72, <span class="smcap">B</span>. Again I damp
a point, and agitate another nearer to the damped one
than in the last instance; the disk divides itself into
eight vibrating segments with lines of sand between
them, Fig. 72, <span class="smcap">C</span>. In this way the disk may be subdivided
into ten, twelve, fourteen, sixteen sectors, the number
of sectors being always an <em>even</em> one. As the division
becomes more minute the vibrations become more rapid,
and the pitch consequently more high. The note emitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
by the sixteen segments into which the disk is now divided
is so acute as to be almost painful to the ear.
Here you have Chladni’s first discovery. You can understand
his emotion on witnessing this wonderful effect,
“which no mortal had previously seen.” By rendering
the centre of the disk free, and damping appropriate
points of the surface, nodal circles and other curved
lines may be obtained.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_188.jpg" width="400" height="140" alt="Fig. 72." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 72.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The rate of vibration of a disk is directly proportional
to its thickness, and inversely proportional to the square
of its diameter. Of these three disks two have the same
diameter, but one is twice as thick as the other; two of
them are of the same thickness, but one has half the
diameter of the other. According to the law just enunciated,
the rules of vibration of the disks are as the numbers
1, 2, 4. When they are sounded in succession, the
musical ears present can testify that they really stand to
each other in the relation of a note, its octave, and its
double octave.</p>


<h3>§ 10. <i>Strehlke and Faraday’s Experiments: Deportment
of Light Powders</i></h3>

<p>The actual movement of the sand toward the nodal
lines may be studied by clogging the sand with a semi-fluid
substance. When gum is employed to retard the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
motion of the particles, the curves which they individually
describe are very clearly drawn upon the plates. M.
Strehlke has sketched these appearances, and from him
the patterns <span class="smcap">A</span>, <span class="smcap">B</span>, <span class="smcap">C</span>, Fig. 73, are borrowed.</p>

</div></td></tr></table>

<p>An effect of vibrating plates which long perplexed experimenters
is here to be noticed. When with the sand
strewed over a plate a little fine dust is mingled, say the
fine seed of lycopodium, this light substance, instead of
collecting along the nodal lines, forms little heaps at the
places of most violent motion. It is heaped at the four
corners of the plate, Fig. 74, at the four sides of the
plate, Fig. 75, and lodged between the nodal lines of the
plate, Fig. 76. These three figures represent the three
states of vibration illustrated in Figs. 64, 65, and 66.
The dust chooses in all cases the place of greatest agitation.
Various explanations of this effect had been given,
but it was reserved for Faraday to assign its extremely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
simple cause. The light powder is entangled by the little
whirlwinds of air produced by the vibrations of the
plate: it cannot escape from the little cyclones, though
the heavier sand particles are readily driven through
them. When, therefore, the motion ceases, the light powder
settles down at the places where the vibration was a
maximum. In vacuo no such effect is observed: here all
powders, light and heavy, move to the nodal lines.</p>


<h3>§ 11. <i>Vibration of Bells: Means of rendering them visible</i></h3>



<p>The vibrating segments and nodes of a bell are similar
to those of a disk. When a bell sounds its deepest note,
the coalescence of its pulses causes it to divide into four
vibrating segments, separated from each other by four
nodal lines, which run up from the sound-bow to the
<span class="figleft200">
<img src="images/i_190.jpg" width="200" height="204" alt="Fig. 77." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 77.</span></span>
</span>
crown of the bell.  The place
where the hammer strikes is always
the middle of a vibrating
segment; the point diametrically
opposite is also the middle of
such a segment. Ninety degrees
from these points, we have also
vibrating segments, while at 45 degrees
right and left of them we
come upon the nodal lines. Supposing
the strong, dark circle in Fig. 77 to represent
the circumference of the bell in a state of quiescence,
then when the hammer falls on any one of the segments
<i>a</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>b</i>, or <i>d</i>, the sound-bow passes periodically through
the changes indicated by the dotted lines. At one moment
it is an oval, with <i>a b</i> for its longest diameter; at
the next moment it is an oval, with <i>c d</i> for its longest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
diameter. The changes from one oval to the other constitute,
in fact, the vibrations of the bell. The four
points <i>n, n, n, n</i>, where the two ovals intersect each
other, are the nodes. As in the case of a disk, the number
of vibrations executed by a bell in a given time
varies directly as the thickness, and inversely as the
square of the bell’s diameter.</p>

<p>Like a disk, also, a bell can divide itself into any
even number of vibrating segments, but not into an odd
number. By damping proper points in succession the
bell can be caused to divide into 6, 8, 10, and 12 vibrating
parts. Beginning with the fundamental note, the
number of vibrations corresponding to the respective
divisions of a bell, as of a disk, is as follows:</p>


<table summary="number of vibrations" border="0"><tr>
<td class="tdl padr1">Number of divisions</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>4, 6, 8, 10, 12</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdl">Numbers the squares of which express the</td><td rowspan="2"><big><big><big>}</big></big></big></td><td rowspan="2">2, 3, 4, 5, 6</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdl">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rates of vibration</td></tr></table>


<p>Thus, if the vibrations of the fundamental tone be 40,
that of the next higher tone will be 90, the next 160,
the next 250, the next 360, and so on. If the bell be
thin, the tendency to subdivision is so great that it is
almost impossible to bring out the pure fundamental tone
without the admixture of the higher ones.</p>

<p>I will now repeat before you a homely, but an instructive
experiment. This common jug, when a fiddle-bow
is drawn across its edge, divides into four vibrating
segments exactly like a bell. The jug is provided with
a handle; and you are to notice the influence of this
handle upon the tone. When the fiddle-bow is drawn
across the edge at a point diametrically opposite to the
handle, a certain note is heard. When it is drawn at a
point 90° from the handle, the same note is heard. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
both these cases the handle occupies the middle of a
vibrating segment, loading that segment by its weight.
But I now draw the bow at an angular distance of 45°
from the handle; the note is sensibly higher than before.
The handle in this experiment occupies a node; it no
longer loads a vibrating segment, and hence the elastic
force, having to cope with less weight, produces a more
rapid vibration. Chladni executed with a teacup the experiment
here made with a jug. Now bells often exhibit
round their sound-bows an absence of uniform thickness
tantamount to the want of symmetry in the case of our
jug; and we shall learn subsequently that the intermittent
sound of many bells, noticed more particularly when
their tones are dying out, is produced by the combination
of two distinct rates of vibration, which have this absence
of uniformity for their origin.</p>

<p>There are no points of absolute rest in a vibrating
bell, for the nodes of the higher tones are not those of
the fundamental one. But it is easy to show that the
various parts of the sound-bow, when the fundamental
tone is predominant, vibrate with very different degrees
of intensity. Suspending a little ball of sealing-wax <i>a</i>,
Fig. 78 (next page), by a string, and allowing it to rest
gently against the interior surface of an inverted bell, it
is tossed to and fro when the bell is thrown into vibration.
But the rattling of the sealing-wax ball is far more
violent when it rests against the vibrating segments than
when it rests against the nodes. Permitting the ivory
bob of a short pendulum to rest in succession against a
vibrating segment and against a node of the “Great
Bell” of Westminster, I found that in the former position
it was driven away five inches, in the latter only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
two inches and three-quarters, when the hammer fell
upon the bell.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="f78" id="f78">
<img src="images/i_193.jpg" width="350" height="290" alt="Fig. 78." /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 78.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Could the “Great Bell” be turned upside down and
filled with water, on striking it the vibrations would
express themselves in beautiful ripples upon the liquid
surface. Similar ripples may be obtained with smaller
bells, or even with finger and claret glasses, but they
would be too minute for our present purpose. Filling
a large hemispherical glass with water, and passing the
fiddle-bow across its edge, large crispations immediately
cover its surface. When the bow is vigorously drawn,
the water rises in spray from the four vibrating segments.
Projecting, by means of a lens, a magnified image of the
illuminated water-surface upon the screen, pass the bow
gently across the edge of the glass, or rub the finger
gently along the edge. You hear this low sound, and
at the same time observe the ripples breaking, as it
were, in visible music over the four sectors of the figure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span></p>

<p>You know the experiment of Leidenfrost which proves
that, if water be poured into a red-hot silver basin, it
rolls about upon its own vapor. The same effect is produced
if we drop a volatile liquid, like ether, on the
surface of warm water. And, if a bell-glass be filled
with ether or with alcohol, a sharp sweep of the bow
over the edge of the glass detaches the liquid spherules,
which, when they fall back, do not mix with the
liquid, but are driven over the surface on wheels of
vapor to the nodal lines. The warming of the liquid,
as might be expected, improves the effect. M. Melde, to
whom we are indebted for this beautiful experiment, has
given the drawings, Figs. 79 and 80, representing what
occurs when the surface is divided into four and into
six vibrating parts. With a thin wineglass and strong
brandy the effect may also be obtained.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<p>The glass and the liquid within it vibrate here together,
and everything that interferes with the perfect
continuity of the entire mass disturbs the sonorous effect.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>A crack in the glass passing from the edge downward
extinguishes its sounding power. A rupture in the continuity
of the liquid has the same effect. When a glass
containing a solution of carbonate of soda is struck with a
bit of wood, you hear a clear musical sound. But when
a little tartaric acid is added to the liquid, it foams, and
a dry, unmusical collision takes the place of the musical
sound. As the foam disappears, the sonorous power returns,
and now that the liquid is once more clear, you
hear the musical ring as before.</p>

<p>The ripples of the tide leave their impressions upon
the sand over which they pass. The ripples produced
by sonorous vibrations have been proved by Faraday competent
to do the same. Attaching a plate of glass to a
long flexible board, and pouring a thin layer of water
over the surface of the glass, on causing the board to vibrate
its tremors chase the water into a beautiful mosaic
of ripples. A thin stratum of sand strewed upon the
plate is acted upon by the water, and carved into patterns,
of which Fig. 81 is a reduced specimen.</p>

<h3>SUMMARY OF CHAPTER IV</h3>


<p>A rod fixed at both ends and caused to vibrate transversely
divides itself in the same manner as a string
vibrating transversely.</p>

<p>But the succession of its overtones is not the same
as those of a string, for while the series of tones emitted
by the string is expressed by the natural numbers 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, etc., the series of tones emitted by the rod is
expressed by the squares of the odd numbers 3, 5,
7, 9, etc.</p>

<p>A rod fixed at one end can also vibrate as a whole,
or can divide itself into vibrating segments separated
from each other by nodes.</p>

<p>In this case the rate of vibration of the fundamental
tone is to that of the first overtone as 4:25, or as the
square of 2 to the square of 5. From the first division
onward the rates of vibration are proportional to the
squares of the odd numbers 3, 5, 7, 9, etc.</p>

<p>With rods of different lengths the rate of vibration
is inversely proportional to the square of the length of
the rod.</p>

<p>Attaching a glass bead silvered within to the free end
of the rod, and illuminating the bead, the spot of light
reflected from it describes curves of various forms when
the rod vibrates. The kaleidophone of Wheatstone is
thus constructed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>

<p>The iron fiddle and the musical box are instruments
whose tones are produced by rods, or tongues, fixed at
one end and free at the other.</p>

<p>A rod free at both ends can also be rendered a source
of sonorous vibrations. In its simplest mode of division
it has two nodes, the subsequent overtones correspond to
divisions by 3, 4, 5, etc., nodes. Beginning with its first
mode of division, the tones of such a rod are represented
by the squares of the odd numbers 3, 5, 7, 9, etc.</p>

<p>The claque-bois, straw-fiddle, and glass harmonica are
instruments whose tones are those of rods or bars free at
both ends, and supported at their nodes.</p>

<p>When a straight bar, free at both ends, is gradually
bent at its centre, the two nodes corresponding to its
fundamental tone gradually approach each other. It
finally assumes the shape of a timing-fork which, when
it sounds its fundamental note, is divided by two nodes
near the base of its two prongs into three vibrating parts.</p>

<p>There is no division of a tuning-fork by three nodes.</p>

<p>In its second mode of division, which corresponds to
the first overtone of the fork, there is a node on each
prong and two others at the bottom of the fork.</p>

<p>The fundamental tone of the fork is to its first overtone
approximately as the square of 2 is to the square
of 5. The vibrations of the first overtone are, therefore,
about 6-1/4 times as rapid as those of the fundamental.
From the first overtone onward the successive rates of
vibration are as the squares of the odd numbers 3, 5,
7, 9, etc.</p>

<p>We are indebted to Chladni for the experimental investigation
of all these points. He was enabled to conduct
his inquiries by means of the discovery that, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
sand is scattered over a vibrating surface, it is driven
from the vibrating portions of the surface, and collects
along the nodal lines.</p>

<p>Chladni embraced in his investigations plates of various
forms. A square plate, for example, clamped at
the centre, and caused to emit its fundamental tone, divides
itself into four smaller squares by lines parallel to
its sides.</p>

<p>The same plate can divide itself into four triangular
vibrating parts, the nodal lines coinciding with the diagonals.
The note produced in this case is a fifth above
the fundamental note of the plate.</p>

<p>The plate may be further subdivided, sand-figures of
extreme beauty being produced; the notes rise in pitch
as the subdivision of the plate becomes more minute.</p>

<p>These figures may be deduced from the coalescence
of different systems of vibration.</p>

<p>When a circular plate clamped at its centre sounds
its fundamental tone, it divides into four vibrating parts,
separated by four radial nodal lines.</p>

<p>The next note of the plate corresponds to a division
into six vibrating sectors, the next note to a division
into eight sectors; such a plate can divide into any even
number of vibrating sectors, the sand-figures assuming
beautiful stellar forms.</p>

<p>The rates of vibration corresponding to the divisions
of a disk are represented by the squares of the numbers
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc. In other words, the rates of vibration
are proportional to the squares of the numbers representing
the sectors into which the disk is divided.</p>

<p>When a bell sounds its deepest note it is divided into
four vibrating parts separated from each other by nodal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
lines, which run upward from the sound-bow and cross
each other at the crown.</p>

<p>It is capable of the same subdivisions as a disk; the
succession of its tones being also the same.</p>

<p>The rate of vibration of a disk or bell is directly
proportional to the thickness and inversely proportional
to the square of the diameter.</p>

<h3>§ 1. <i>Longitudinal Vibrations of Wires and Rods: Conversion
of Longitudinal into Transverse Vibrations</i></h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>E HAVE thus far occupied ourselves exclusively
with transversal vibrations; that is to say, vibrations
executed at right angles to the lengths
of the strings, rods, plates, and bells subjected to examination.
A string is also capable of vibrating in the direction
of its length, but here the power which enables it
to vibrate is not a tension applied externally, but the
elastic force of its own molecules. Now this molecular
elasticity is much greater than any that we can ordinarily
develop by stretching the string, and the consequence
is that the sounds produced by the <em>longitudinal
vibrations</em> of a string are, as a general rule, much more
acute than those produced by its transverse vibrations.
These longitudinal vibrations may be excited by the oblique
passage of a fiddle-bow; but they are more easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
produced by passing briskly along the string a bit of
cloth or leather on which powdered resin has been
strewed. The resined fingers answer the same purpose.</p>

<p>When the wire of our monochord is plucked aside,
you hear the sound produced by its transverse vibrations.
When resined leather is rubbed along the wire, a
note much more piercing than the last is heard. This is
due to the longitudinal vibrations of the wire. Behind
the table is stretched a stout iron wire 23 feet long.
One end of it is firmly attached to an immovable wooden
tray, the other end is coiled round a pin fixed firmly into
one of our benches. With a key this pin can be turned,
and the wire stretched so as to facilitate the passage of
the rubber. Clasping the wire with the resined leather,
and passing the hand to and fro along it, a rich, loud
musical sound is heard. Halving the wire at its centre,
and rubbing one of its halves, the note heard is the
octave of the last: the vibrations are twice as rapid.
When the wire is clipped at one-third of its length and
the shorter segment rubbed, the note is a fifth above the
octave. Taking one-fourth of its length and rubbing as
before, the note yielded is the double octave of that of
the whole wire, being produced by four times the number
of vibrations. Thus, in longitudinal as well as in
transverse vibrations, the number of vibrations executed
in a given time <em>is inversely proportional to the length of
the wire</em>.</p>

<p>And notice the surprising power of these sounds when
the wire is rubbed vigorously. With a shorter length,
the note is so acute, and at the same time so powerful,
as to be hardly bearable. It is not the wire itself which
produces this intense sound; it is the wooden tray at its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
end to which its vibrations are communicated. And, the
vibrations of the wire being longitudinal, those of the
tray, which is at right angles to the wire, must be transversal.
We have here, indeed, an instructive example of
the conversion of longitudinal into transverse vibrations.</p>


<h3>§ 2. <i>Longitudinal Pulses in Iron and Brass: their Relative
Velocities determined</i></h3>

<p>Causing the wire to vibrate again longitudinally
through its entire length, my assistant shall at the same
time turn the key at the end, thus changing the tension.
You notice no variation of the note. The longitudinal
vibrations of the wire, unlike the transverse ones, are
independent of the tension. Beside the iron wire is
stretched a second, of brass, of the same length and
thickness. I rub them both. Their tones are not the
same; that of the iron wire is considerably the higher of
the two. Why? Simply because the velocity of the
sound-pulse is greater in iron than in brass. The pulses
in this case pass to and fro from end to end of the wire.
At one moment the wire pushes the tray at its end; at
the next moment it pulls the tray, this pushing and pulling
being due to the passage of the pulse to and fro
along the whole wire. The time required for a pulse to
run from one end to the other <em>and back</em> is that of a complete
vibration. In that time the wire imparts one push
and one pull to the wooden tray at its end; the wooden
tray imparts one complete vibration to the air, and the
air bends once in and once out the tympanic membrane.
It is manifest that the rapidity of vibration, or, in other
words, the pitch of the note, depends upon the velocity
with which the sound-pulse is transmitted through the wire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span></p>

<p>And now the solution of a beautiful problem falls of
itself into our hands. By shortening the brass wire we
cause it to emit a note of the same pitch as that emitted
by the other. You hear both notes now sounding in
unison, and the reason is that the sound-pulse travels
through these 23 feet of iron wire, and through these 15
feet 6 inches of brass wire, in the same time. These
lengths are in the ratio of 11:17, and these two numbers
express the relative velocities of sound in brass and
iron. In fact, the former velocity is 11,000 feet, and the
latter 17,000 feet a second. The same method is of
course applicable to many other metals.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_203.jpg" width="400" height="111" alt="Fig. 82." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 82.</span></div>
</div>

<p>When a wire or string, vibrating longitudinally, emits
its lowest note, there is no node whatever upon it; the
pulse, as just stated, runs to and fro along the whole
length. But, like a string vibrating transversely, it can
also subdivide itself into ventral segments separated by
nodes. By damping the centre of the wire we make that
point a node. The pulses here run from both ends, meet
in the centre, recoil from each other, and return to the
ends, where they are reflected as before. The note produced
is the octave of the fundamental note. The next
higher note corresponds to the division of the wire into
three vibrating segments, separated from each other by
two nodes. The first of these three modes of vibration
is shown in Fig. 82, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>; the second at <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
the third at <i>e</i> and <i>f</i>; the nodes being marked by dotted
transverse lines, and the arrows in each case pointing out
the direction in which the pulse moves. The rates of
vibration follow the order of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
etc., just as in the case of a wire vibrating transversely.</p>

<p>A <em>rod</em> or <em>bar</em> of wood or metal, with its two ends
fixed, and vibrating longitudinally, divides itself in the
same manner as the wire. The succession of tones is
also the same in both cases.</p>


<h3>§ 3. <i>Longitudinal Vibrations of Rods fixed at One End:
Musical Instruments formed on this Principle</i></h3>



<p>Rods and bars <em>with one end fixed</em> are also capable of
vibrating longitudinally. A smooth wooden or metal
rod, for example, with one of its ends fixed in a vise,
yields a musical note, when the resined fingers are passed
along it. When such a note yields its lowest note, it
simply elongates and shortens in quick alternation; there
is, then, no node upon the rod. The pitch of the note is
<span class="figleft250">
<img src="images/i_204.jpg" width="250" height="199" alt="Fig. 83." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 83.</span></span>
</span>
inversely proportional to the
length of the rod. This follows
necessarily from the fact
that the time of a complete
vibration is the time required
for the sonorous pulse to run
twice to and fro over the
rod. The first overtone of a
rod, fixed at one end, corresponds
to its division by a node at a point one-third of
its length from its free end. Its second overtone corresponds
to a division by two nodes, the highest of which
is at a point one-fifth of the length of the rod from its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
free end, the remainder of the rod being divided into
two equal parts by the second node. In Fig. 83, <i>a</i> and
<i>b</i>, <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>, <i>e</i> and <i>f</i>, are shown the conditions of the rod
answering to its first three modes of vibration: the nodes,
<span class="figright250">
<img src="images/i_205.jpg" width="250" height="443" alt="Fig. 84." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 84.</span></span>
</span>
as before, are marked by
dotted lines, the arrows in
the respective cases marking
the direction of the pulses.</p>



<p>The order of the tones
of a rod fixed at one end
and vibrating longitudinally
is that of the odd numbers 1,
3, 5, 7, etc. It is easy to see
that this must be the case.
For the time of vibration of
<i>c</i> or <i>d</i> is that of the segment
above the dotted line: and
the length of this segment
being only one-third that of
the whole rod, its vibrations
must be three times as rapid.
The time of vibration in <i>e</i> or
<i>f</i> is also that of its highest
segment, and as this segment is one-fifth of the length of
the whole rod, its vibrations must be five times as rapid.
Thus the order of the tones must be that of the odd
numbers.</p>

<p>Before you, Fig. 84, is a musical instrument, the
sounds of which are due to the longitudinal vibrations
of a number of deal rods of different lengths. Passing
the resined fingers over the rods in succession, a series
of notes of varying pitch is obtained. An expert per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>former
might render the tones of this instrument very
pleasant to you.</p>


<h3>§ 4. <i>Vibrations of Rods free at Both Ends</i></h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_206.jpg" width="400" height="211" alt="Fig. 85." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 85.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Rods <em>with both ends free</em> are also capable of vibrating
longitudinally, and producing musical tones. The investigation
of this subject will lead us to exceedingly important
results. Clasping a long glass tube exactly at its
centre, and passing a wetted cloth over one of its halves,
a clear musical sound is the result. A solid glass rod
of the same length would yield the same note. In this
case the centre of the tube is a node, and the two halves
elongate and shorten in quick alternation. M. König, of
Paris, has provided us with an instrument which will
illustrate this action. A rod of brass, <i>a b</i>, Fig. 85, is
held at its centre by the clamp <i>s</i>, while an ivory ball,
suspended by two strings from the points, <i>m</i> and <i>n</i>, of
a wooden frame, is caused to rest against the end, <i>b</i>, of
the brass rod. Drawing gently a bit of resined leather
over the rod near <i>a</i>, it is thrown into longitudinal vibration.
The centre, <i>s</i>, is a node; but the uneasiness of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
ivory ball shows you that the end, <i>b</i>, is in a state of
tremor. I apply the rubber still more briskly. The ball,
<i>b</i>, rattles, and now the vibration is so intense that the
ball is rejected with violence whenever it comes into
contact with the end of the rod.</p>


<h3>§ 5. <i>Fracture of Glass Tube by Sonorous Vibrations</i></h3>

<p>When the wetted cloth is passed over the surface of
a glass tube the film of liquid left behind by the cloth
is seen forming narrow tremulous rings all along the rod.
Now this shivering of the liquid is due to the shivering
of the glass underneath it, and it is possible so to augment
the intensity of the vibration that the glass shall
actually go to pieces. Savart was the first to show this.
Twice in this place I have repeated this experiment,
sacrificing in each case a fine glass tube 6 feet long and
2 inches in diameter. Seizing the tube at its centre <span class="smcap">C</span>,
Fig. 86, I swept my hand vigorously to and fro along <span class="smcap">C</span>
<span class="smcap">D</span>, until finally the half most distant from my hand was
shivered into annular fragments. On examining these it
was found that, narrow as they were, many of them
were marked by circular cracks indicating a still more
minute subdivision.</p>

<p>In this case also the rapidity of vibration is inversely
proportional to the length of the rod. A rod of half the
length vibrates longitudinally with double the rapidity, a
rod of one-third the length with treble the rapidity, and
so on. The time of a complete vibration being that required
by the pulse to travel to and fro over the rod,
and that time being directly proportional to the length
of the rod, the rapidity of vibration must, of necessity,
be in the inverse proportion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft100">
<img src="images/i_208a.jpg" width="100" height="442" alt="Fig. 86." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 86.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_208b.jpg" width="100" height="425" alt="Fig. 87." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 87.</span></div>
</div>

<p>This division of a rod by a single node at its centre
corresponds to the deepest tone produced by its longitudinal
vibration. But, as in all other cases hitherto
examined, such rods can
subdivide themselves further.
Holding the long
glass rod <i>a e</i>, Fig. 87, at a
point <i>b</i>, midway between its
centre and one of its ends,
and rubbing its short section,
<i>a b</i>, with a wet cloth,
the point <i>b</i> becomes a node,
a second node, <i>d</i>, being
formed at the same distance
from the opposite end of the
rod. Thus we have the rod
divided into three vibrating
parts, consisting of one
whole ventral segment, <i>b d</i>,
and two half ones, <i>a b</i> and
<i>d e</i>. The sound corresponding
to this division of the
rod is the octave of its
fundamental note.</p>



<p>You have now a means
of checking me. For, if the
second mode of division just
described produces the octave
of the fundamental note, and if a rod of half the
length produces the same octave, then the whole rod
held at a point one-fourth of its length from one of its
ends ought to emit the same note as the half rod held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
in the middle. When both notes are sounded together
they are heard to be identical in pitch.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_209.jpg" width="400" height="118" alt="Fig. 88." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 88.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 88, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>, <i>e</i> and <i>f</i>, shows the three
first divisions of a rod free at both ends and vibrating
longitudinally. The nodes, as before, are marked by
transverse dots, the direction of the pulses being shown
by arrows. The order of the tones is that of the numbers,
1, 3, 4, etc.</p>


<h3>§ 6. <i>Action of Sonorous Vibrations on Polarized Light</i></h3>

<p>When a tube or rod vibrating longitudinally yields
its fundamental tone, its two ends are in a state of free
vibration, the glass there suffering neither strain nor
pressure. The case at the centre is exactly the reverse;
here there is no vibration, but a quick alternation of tension
and compression. When the sonorous pulses meet
at the centre they squeeze the glass; when they recoil
they strain it. <em>Thus while at the ends we have the maximum
of vibration, but no change of density, at the centre we
have the maximum changes of density, but no vibration.</em></p>

<p>We have now cleared the way for the introduction
of a very beautiful experiment made many years ago by
Biot, but never, to my knowledge, repeated on the scale
here presented to you. The beam from our electric
lamp, <span class="smcap">L</span>, Fig. 89, being sent through a prism, <span class="smcap">B</span>, of bi-refracting
spar, a beam of polarized light is obtained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
This beam impinges on a second prism of spar, <i>n</i>, but,
though both prisms are perfectly transparent, the light
which has passed through the first cannot get through
the second. By introducing a piece of glass between the
two prisms, and subjecting the glass to either strain or
pressure, the light is enabled to pass through the entire
system.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_210.jpg" width="450" height="288" alt="Fig. 89." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 89.</span></div>
</div>

<p>I now introduce between the prisms <span class="smcap">B</span> and <i>n</i> a rectangle,
<i>s s′</i>, of plate glass, 6 feet long, 2 inches wide,
and one-third of an inch thick, which is to be thrown
into longitudinal vibration. The beam from <span class="smcap">L</span> passes
through the glass at a point near its centre, which is
held in a vise, <i>c</i>, so that when a wet cloth is passed
over one of the halves, <i>c s′</i>, of the strip, the centre will
be a node. During its longitudinal vibration the glass
near the centre is, as already explained, alternately
strained and compressed; and this successive strain and
pressure so changes the condition of the light as to enable
it to pass through the second prism. The screen is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
now dark; but on passing the wetted cloth briskly over
the glass a brilliant disk of light, three feet in diameter,
flashes out upon the screen. The vibration quickly subsides,
and the luminous disk as quickly disappears, to
be, however, revived at will by the passage of the wetted
cloth along the glass.</p>

<p>The light of this disk appears to be continuous, but
it is really intermittent, for it is only when the glass is
under strain or pressure that the light can get through.
In passing from strain to pressure, and from pressure
to strain, the glass is for a moment in its natural state,
which, if it continued, would leave the screen dark. But
the impressions of brightness, due to the strains and
pressures, remain far longer upon the retina than is
necessary to abolish the intervals of darkness; hence the
screen appears illuminated by a continuous light. When
the glass rectangle is shifted so as to cause the beam of
polarized light to pass through it close to its end, <i>s</i>, the
longitudinal vibrations of the glass have no effect whatever
upon the polarized beam.</p>

<p>Thus, by means of this subtile investigator, we demonstrate
that, while the centre of the glass, where the
vibration is <em>nil</em>, is subjected to quick alternations of
strain and pressure, the ends of the rectangle, where
the vibration is a maximum, suffer neither.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>


<h3>§ 7. <i>Vibrations of Rods of Wood: Determination of Relative
Velocities in Different Woods</i></h3>

<p>Rods of wood and metal also yield musical tones when
they vibrate longitudinally. Here, however, the rubber
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>employed is not a wet cloth, but a piece of leather covered
with powdered resin. The resined fingers also elicit
the music of the rods. The modes of vibration here are
those already indicated, the pitch, however, varying with
the velocity of the sonorous pulse in the respective substances.
When two rods of the same length, the one of
deal, the other of Spanish mahogany, are sounded together,
the pitch of the one is much lower than that of
the other. Why? Simply because the sonorous pulses
pass more slowly through the mahogany than through
the deal. Can we find the relative velocity of sound
through both? With the greatest ease. We have only
to carefully shorten the mahogany rod till it yields the
same note as the deal one. The notes, rendered approximate
by the first trials, are now identical. Through this
rod of mahogany 4 feet long, and through this rod of
deal 6 feet long, the sound-pulse passes in the same time,
and these numbers express the relative velocities of sound
through the two substances.</p>

<p>Modes of investigation, which could only be hinted at
in our earlier lectures, are now falling naturally into our
hands. When in the first lecture the velocity of sound
in air was spoken of, many possible methods of determining
this velocity must have occurred to your minds, because
here we have miles of space to operate upon. Its
velocity through wood or metal, where such distances are
out of the question, is determined in the simple manner
just indicated. From the notes which they emit when
suitably prepared, we may infer with certainty the <em>relative</em>
velocities of sound through different solid substances;
and determining the ratio of the velocity in any one of
them to its velocity in air, we are able to draw up a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
table of absolute velocities. But how is air to be introduced
into the series? We shall soon be able to answer
this question, approaching it, however, through a number
of phenomena with which, at first sight, it appears to have
no connection.</p>


<h3>RESONANCE</h3>

<h3>§ 8. <i>Experiments with Resonant Jars. Analysis and
Explanation</i></h3>

<p>The series of tuning-forks now before you have had
their rates of vibration determined by the siren. One,
you will remember, vibrates 256 times in a second, the
length of its sonorous wave being 4 feet 4 inches. It is
detached from its case, so that when struck against a pad
you hardly hear it. When held over this glass jar, <span class="smcap">A B</span>,
Fig. 90, 18 inches deep, you still fail to hear the sound
of the fork. Preserving the fork in its position, I pour
water with the least possible noise into the jar. The
column of air underneath the fork shortens, the sound
augments in intensity, and when the water has reached
a certain level it bursts forth with extraordinary power.
A greater quantity of water causes the sound to sink,
and become finally inaudible, as at first. By pouring
the water carefully out, a point is reached where the
reinforcement of the sound again occurs. Experimenting
thus, we learn that there is one particular length of
the column of air which, when the fork is placed above
it, produces a maximum augmentation of the sound.
This reinforcement of the sound is named <em>resonance</em>.</p>

<p>Operating in the same way with all the forks in succession,
a column of air is found for each, which yields<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
a maximum resonance. These columns become shorter as
the rapidity of vibration increases.  In Fig. 91 the series
<span class="figleft300">
<img src="images/i_214a.jpg" width="300" height="390" alt="Fig. 90." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 90.</span></span>
</span>
of jars is represented, the
number of vibrations to
which each resounds being
placed above it.</p>




<p>What is the physical
meaning of this very wonderful
effect? To solve
this question we must revive
our knowledge of the
relation of the motion of
the fork itself to the motion
of the sonorous wave
produced by the fork.
Supposing a prong of this
fork, which executes 256
vibrations in a second, to
vibrate between the points <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, Fig. 92, in its motion
from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> the fork generates half a sonorous wave, and
<span class="figleft225">
<img src="images/i_214b.jpg" width="225" height="213" alt="Fig. 91." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 91.</span></span>
</span>
as the length of the whole wave
emitted by this fork is 4 feet 4
inches, at the moment the prong
reaches <i>b</i> the foremost point of the
sonorous wave will be at <span class="smcap">C</span>, 2 feet
2 inches distant from the fork.
The motion of the wave, then, is
vastly greater than that of the
fork. In fact, the distance <i>a b</i> is,
in this case, not more than one-twentieth of an inch, while
the wave has passed over a distance of 26 inches. With
forks of lower pitch the difference would be still greater.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_215a.jpg" width="400" height="158" alt="Fig. 92." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 92.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Our next question is, what is the length of the column
of air which resounds to this fork? By measurement
with a two-foot rule it is found to be 13 inches.
But the length of the wave emitted by the fork is 52
inches; hence <em>the length of the column of air which resounds
to the fork is equal to one-fourth of the length of the
sound-wave produced by the fork</em>. This rule is general, and
might be illustrated by any other of
the forks instead of this one.</p>

<div class="figright"><a name="f93" id="f93">
<img src="images/i_215b.jpg" width="150" height="243" alt="Fig. 93." /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 93.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Let the prong, vibrating between
the limits <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, be placed over its
resonant jar, <span class="smcap">A B</span>, Fig. 93. In the
time required by the prong to move
from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>, the condensation it produces
runs down to the bottom of the
jar, is there reflected, and, as the distance
to the bottom and back is 26
inches, the reflected wave will reach
the fork at the moment when it is on the point of returning
from <i>b</i> to <i>a</i>. The rarefaction of the wave is produced
by the retreat of the prong from <i>b</i> to <i>a</i>. This
rarefaction will also run to the bottom of the jar and
back, overtaking the prong just as it reaches the limit,
<i>a</i>, of its excursion. It is plain from this analysis that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
the vibrations of the fork are perfectly synchronous with
the vibrations of the aërial column <span class="smcap">A B</span>; and in virtue
of this synchronism the motion accumulates in the jar,
spreads abroad in the room, and produces this vast augmentation
of the sound.</p>

<p>When we substitute for the air in one of these jars
a gas of different elasticity, we find the length of the resounding
column to be different. The velocity of sound
through coal-gas is to its velocity in air about as 8:5.
Hence, to synchronize with our fork, a jar filled with
coal-gas must be deeper than one filled with air. I turn
this jar, 18 inches long, upside down, and hold close to
its open mouth our agitated tuning-fork. It is scarcely
audible. The jar, with air in it, is 5 inches too deep for
this fork. Let coal-gas now enter the jar. As it ascends
the note at a certain point swells out, proving that for
the more elastic gas a depth of 18 inches is not too
great. In fact, it is not great enough; for if too much
gas be allowed to enter the jar the resonance is weakened.
By suddenly turning the jar upright, still holding
the fork close to its mouth, the gas escapes, and at the
point of proper admixture of gas and air the note swells
out again.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>


<h3>§ 9. <i>Reinforcement of Bell by Resonance</i></h3>

<p>This fine, sonorous bell, Fig. 94, is thrown into intense
vibration by the passage of a resined bow across its edge.
You hear its sound, pure, but not very forcible. When,
however, the open mouth of this large tube, which is
closed at one end, is brought close to one of the vibrat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>ing
segments of the bell, the tone swells into a musical
roar. As the tube is alternately withdrawn and advanced,
the sound sinks and swells in this extraordinary manner.</p>

</div>

<p>The second tube, open at both ends, is capable of
being lengthened and shortened by a telescopic slider.
When brought near the vibrating bell, the resonance is
feeble. On lengthening the tube by drawing out the
slider at a certain point, the tone swells out as before.
If the tube be made longer, the resonance is again enfeebled.
Note the fact, which shall be explained presently,
that the open tube which gives the maximum resonance
is exactly twice the length of the closed one.
For these fine experiments we are indebted to Savart.</p>


<h3>§ 10. <i>Expenditure of Motion in Resonance</i></h3>

<p>With the India-rubber tube employed in our third
chapter it was found necessary to time the impulses
properly, so as to produce the various ventral segments.
I could then feel that the muscular work performed,
when the impulses were properly timed, was greater than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
when they were irregular. The same truth may be illustrated
by a claret-glass half filled with water. Endeavor
to move your hand to and fro, in accordance with the
oscillating period of the water: when you have thoroughly
established synchronism, the work thrown upon
the hand apparently augments the weight of the water.
So likewise with our tuning-fork; when its impulses are
timed to the vibrations of the column of air contained in
this jar, its work is greater than when they are not so
timed. As a consequence of this the tuning-fork comes
sooner to rest when it is placed over the jar than when
it is permitted to vibrate either in free air, or over a jar
of a depth unsuited to its periods of vibration.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<p>Reflecting on what we have now learned, you would
have little difficulty in solving the following beautiful
problem: You are provided with a tuning-fork and a
siren, and are required by means of these two instruments
to determine the velocity of sound in air. To
solve this problem you lack, if anything, the mere power
of manipulation which practice imparts. You would first
determine, by means of the siren, the number of vibrations
executed by the tuning-fork in a second; you would
then determine the length of the column of air which resounds
to the fork. This length multiplied by 4 would
give you, approximately, the wave-length of the fork,
and the wave-length multiplied by the number of vibrations
in a second would give you the velocity in a second.
Without quitting your private room, therefore, you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>could solve this important problem. We will go on, if
you please, in this fashion, making our footing sure as
we advance.</p>


<h3>§ 11. <i>Resonators of Helmholtz</i></h3>

<p>Helmholtz has availed himself of the principle of resonance
in analyzing composite sounds. He employs little
hollow spheres, called <em>resonators</em>, one of which is shown
in Fig. 94<i>a</i>. The small projection
<i>b</i>, which has an orifice, is
placed in the ear, while the sound-waves
enter the hollow sphere
through the wide aperture at <i>a</i>.
Reinforced by the resonance of
such a cavity, and rendered
thereby more powerful than its companions, a particular
note of a composite clang may be in a measure isolated
and studied alone.</p>


<h3>ORGAN-PIPES</h3>

<h3>§ 12. <i>Principles of Resonance applied to Organ-Pipes</i></h3>

<p>Thus disciplined we are prepared to consider the subject
of organ-pipes, which is one of great importance.
Before me on the table are two resonant jars, and in
my right hand and my left are held two tuning-forks. I
agitate both, and hold them over this jar. One of them
only is heard. Held over the other jar, the other fork
alone is heard. Each jar selects that fork whose periods
of vibration synchronize with its own. And instead of
two forks suppose several of them to be held over the
jar; from the confused assemblage of pulses thus gener<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>ated,
the jar would select and reinforce that one which
corresponds to its own period of vibration.</p>

<p>When I blow across the open mouth of the jar, or,
better still, for the jar is too wide for this experiment,
when I blow across the open end of a glass tube, <i>t u</i>,
Fig. 95, of the same length as the jar, a fluttering of the
air is thereby produced, an assemblage of pulses at the
open mouth of the tube being generated. And what is
the consequence? The tube selects that pulse of the
flutter which is in synchronism with itself, and
raises it to a musical sound. The sound, you
perceive, is precisely that obtained when the
proper tuning-fork is placed over the tube. The
column of air within the tube has, in this case,
virtually created its own tuning-fork; for by
the reaction of its pulses upon the sheet of air
issuing from the lips it has compelled that sheet
to vibrate in synchronism with itself, and made
it thus act the part of the tuning-fork.</p>

<div class="figleft100">
<img src="images/i_220.jpg" width="100" height="348" alt="Fig. 95." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 95.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Selecting for each of the other tuning-forks
a resonant tube, in every case, on blowing across
the open end of the tube, a tone is produced
identical in pitch with that obtained through
resonance.</p>

<p>When different tubes are compared, the rate of vibration
is found to be inversely proportional to the length
of the tube. These three tubes are 24, 12, and 6 inches
long, respectively. I blow gently across the 24-inch tube,
and bring out its fundamental note; similarly treated, the
12-inch tube yields the octave of the note of the 24-inch.
In like manner the 6-inch tube yields the octave of the
12-inch. It is plain that this must be the case; for,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
the rate of vibration depending on the distance which
the pulse has to travel to complete a vibration, if in
one case this distance be twice what it is in another,
the rate of vibration must be twice as slow. In general
terms, the rate of vibration is inversely proportional to
the length of the tube through which the pulse passes.</p>


<h3>§ 13. <i>Vibrations of Stopped Pipes: Modes of Division:
Overtones</i></h3>

<p>But that the current of air should be thus able to accommodate
itself to the requirements of the tube, it must
enjoy a certain amount of <em>flexibility</em>. A little reflection
will show you that the power of the reflected pulse over
the current must depend to some extent on the force of
the current. A stronger current, like a more powerfully
stretched string, requires a great force to deflect it, and
when deflected vibrates more quickly. Accordingly, to
obtain the fundamental note of this 24-inch tube, we
must blow very gently across its open end; a rich, full,
and forcible musical tone is then produced. With a little
stronger blast the sound approaches a mere rustle; blowing
stronger still, a tone is obtained of much higher
pitch than the fundamental one. This is the first overtone
of the tube, to produce which the column of air
within it has divided itself into two vibrating parts,
with a node between them. With a still stronger blast
a still higher note is obtained. The tube is now divided
into three vibrating parts, separated from each
other by two nodes. Once more I blow with sudden
strength; a higher note than any before obtained is
the consequence.</p>

<p>In Fig. 96 are represented the divisions of the column<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
of air corresponding to the first three notes of a tube
stopped at one end. At <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, which correspond to
the fundamental note, the column is undivided; the bottom
of the tube is the only node, and the pulse simply
moves up and down from top to bottom, as denoted by
the arrows. In <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>, which correspond to the first
overtone of the tube, we have one nodal surface shown
by dots at <i>x</i>, against which the pulses abut, and from
which they are reflected as from a fixed surface. This
nodal surface is situated at one-third of the length of the
tube from its open end. In <i>e</i> and <i>f</i>, which correspond to
the second overtone, we have two nodal surfaces, the
upper one, <i>x′</i>, of which is
at one-fifth of the length
of the tube from its open
end, the remaining four-fifths
being divided into
two equal parts by the
second nodal surface. The
arrows, as before, mark the
directions of the pulses.</p>

<div class="figleft250">
<img src="images/i_222.jpg" width="250" height="177" alt="Fig. 96." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 96.</span></div>
</div>

<p>We have now to inquire into the relation of these
successive notes to each other. The space from node
to node has been called all through “a ventral segment”;
hence the space between the middle of a ventral segment
and a node is a semi-ventral segment. You will readily
bear in mind the law that <em>the number of vibrations is
directly proportional to the number of semi-ventral segments</em>
into which the column of air within the tube is divided.
Thus, when the fundamental note is sounded, we have
but a single semi-ventral segment, as at <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. The
bottom here is a node, and the open end of the tube,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
where the air is agitated, is the middle of a ventral segment.
The mode of division represented in <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>
yields three semi-ventral segments; in <i>e</i> and <i>f</i> we have
five. The vibrations, therefore, corresponding to this
series of notes, augment in the proportion of the series
of odd numbers 1:3:5. Could we obtain still higher
notes, their relative rates of vibration would continue to
be represented by the odd numbers 7, 9, 11, 13, etc.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_223.jpg" width="225" height="173" alt="Fig. 97." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 97.</span></div>
</div>

<p>It is evident that this <em>must</em> be the law of succession.
For the time of vibration in <i>c</i> or <i>d</i> is that of a stopped
tube of the length <i>x y</i>; but this length is one-third of
the length of the whole tube, consequently its vibrations
must be three times as rapid.
The time of vibration in <i>e</i> or
<i>f</i> is that of a stopped tube
of the length <i>x′ y′</i>, and inasmuch
as this length is one-fifth
that of the whole tube,
its vibrations must be five times
as rapid. We thus obtain the
succession 1, 3, 5; if we pushed matters further we should
obtain the continuation of the series of odd numbers.</p>



<p>And here it is once more in your power to subject
my statements to an experimental test. Here are two
tubes, one of which is three times the length of the
other. I sound the fundamental note of the longest
tube, and then the next note above the fundamental.
The vibrations of these two notes are stated to be in
the ratio of 1:3. This latter note, therefore, ought to be
of precisely the same pitch as the fundamental note of
the shorter of the two tubes. When both tubes are
sounded their notes are identical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span></p>

<p>It is only necessary to place a series of such tubes of
different lengths thus together to form that ancient instrument,
Pan’s pipes, <span class="smcap">p p′</span>, Fig. 97 (page 223), with
which we are so well acquainted.</p>

<p>The successive divisions, and the relation of the overtones
of a rod fixed at one end (described in page 205), are
plainly identical with those of a column of air in a tube
stopped at one end, which we have been here considering.</p>


<h3>§ 14. <i>Vibrations of Open Pipes: Modes of Division:
Overtones</i></h3>

<p>From tubes closed at one end, and which, for the sake
of brevity, may be called stopped tubes, we now pass to
tubes open at both ends, which we shall call open tubes.
Comparing, in the first instance, a stopped tube with an
open one of the same length, we find the note of the
latter an octave higher than that of the former. This result
is general. To make an open tube yield the same
note as a closed one, it must be twice the length of the
latter. And, since the length of a closed tube sounding
its fundamental note is one-fourth of the length of its
sonorous wave, the length of an open tube is one-half
that of the sonorous wave that it produces.</p>

<p>It is not easy to obtain a sustained musical note by
blowing across the end of an open glass tube; but a
mere puff of breath across the end reveals the pitch to
the disciplined ear. In each case it is that of a closed
tube half the length of the open one.</p>

</div>

<p>There are various ways of agitating the air at the
ends of pipes and tubes, so as to throw the air-columns
within them into vibration. In organ-pipes this is done
by blowing a thin sheet of air against a sharp edge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
You will have no difficulty
in understanding the construction
of an open organ-pipe,
from this model, Fig. 98, one
side of which has been removed
so that you may see
its inner parts. Through the
tube <i>t</i> the air passes from
the wind-chest into the chamber,
<span class="smcap">C</span>, which is closed at the
top, save a narrow slit, <i>e d</i>,
through which the compressed
air of the chamber issues.
This thin air-current breaks
against the sharp edge, <i>a b</i>,
and there produces a fluttering
noise, and the proper
pulse of this flutter is converted
by the resonance of
the pipe above into a musical
sound. The open space between
the edge, <i>a b</i>, and the
slit below it is called the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">embouchure</em>.
Fig. 99 represents
a stopped pipe of the same
length as that shown in Fig.
98, and hence producing a
note an octave lower.</p>



<p>Instead of a fluttering sheet
of air, a tuning-fork whose rate
of vibration synchronizes with
that of the organ-pipe may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
placed at the embouchure, as at <span class="smcap">a b</span>, Fig. 100. The
pipe will resound. Here, for example, are four open
pipes of different lengths, and four tuning-forks of
different rates of vibration. Striking the most slowly
vibrating fork, and bringing it near the embouchure of
the longest pipe, the pipe <em>speaks</em> powerfully. When
blown into, the same pipe yields a tone identical with
that of the tuning-fork. Going through all the pipes
in succession, we find in each case that the note obtained
<span class="figleft200">
<img src="images/i_226.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt="Fig. 100." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 100.</span></span>
</span>
by blowing into the pipe
is exactly that produced when
the proper tuning-fork is placed
at the embouchure. Conceive
now the four forks placed together
near the same embouchure;
we should have pulses of
four different periods there excited;
but out of the four the
pipe would select only one.
And if four hundred vibrating
forks could be placed there instead
of four, the pipe would still
make the proper selection. This it
also does when for the pulses of tuning-forks we substitute
the assemblage of pulses created by the current of air
when it strikes against the sharp upper edge of the
embouchure.</p>



<p>The heavy vibrating mass of the tuning-fork is practically
uninfluenced by the motion of the air within the
pipe. But this is not the case when air itself is the
vibrating body. Here, as before explained, the pipe
creates, as it were, its own tuning-fork, by compelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
the fluttering stream at its embouchure to vibrate in
periods answering to its own.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_227.jpg" width="125" height="471" alt="Fig. 101." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 101.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The condition of the air within an open organ-pipe,
when its fundamental note is sounded, is that of a rod
free at both ends, held at its centre, and caused to vibrate
longitudinally. The two ends are
places of vibration, the centre is a node.
Is there any way of <em>feeling</em> the vibrating
air-column so as to determine its nodes
and its places of vibration? The late excellent
William Hopkins has taught us
the following mode of solving this problem:
Over a little hoop is stretched a
thin membrane, forming a little tambourine.
The front of this organ-pipe, <span class="smcap">P P′</span>,
Fig. 101, is of glass, through which you
can see the position of any body within
it. By means of a string, the little tambourine,
<i>m</i>, can be raised or lowered at
pleasure through the entire length of the
pipe. When held above the upper end of
the pipe, you hear the loud buzzing of the
membrane. When lowered into the pipe,
it continues to buzz for a time; the sound
becoming gradually feebler, and finally
ceasing totally. It is now in the middle
of the pipe, where it cannot vibrate, because the air
around it is at rest. On lowering it still further, the
buzzing sound instantly recommences, and continues
down to the bottom of the pipe. Thus, as the membrane
is raised and lowered in quick succession, during
every descent and ascent, we have two periods of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
sound separated from each other by one of silence. If
sand were strewed upon the membrane, it would dance
above and below, but it would be quiescent at the centre.
We thus prove experimentally that, when an organ-pipe
sounds its fundamental note, it divides itself into two
semi-ventral segments separated by a node.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_228.jpg" width="500" height="146" alt="Fig. 102." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 102.</span></div>
</div>

<p>What is the condition of the air at this node? Again,
that of the middle of a rod, free at both ends, and yielding
the fundamental note of its longitudinal vibration.
The pulses reflected from both ends of the rod, or of the
column of air, meet in the middle, and produce compression;
they then retreat and produce rarefaction. Thus,
while there is no vibration in the centre of an organ-pipe,
the air there undergoes the greatest changes of
density. At the two ends of the pipe, on the other
hand, the air-particles merely swing up and down without
sensible compression or rarefaction.</p>

<p>If the sounding pipe were pierced at the centre, and
the orifice stopped by a membrane, the air, when condensed,
would press the membrane outward, and, when
rarefied, the external air would press the membrane inward.
The membrane would therefore vibrate in unison
with the column of air. The organ-pipe, Fig. 102, is so
arranged that a small jet of gas, <i>b</i>, can be lighted opposite
the centre of the pipe, and there acted upon by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
vibrations of a membrane. Two other gas-jets, <i>a</i> and <i>c</i>,
are placed nearly midway between the centre and the
two ends of the pipe. The three burners, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, are
fed in the following manner: through the tube, <i>t</i>, the gas
enters the hollow chamber, <i>e d</i>, from which issue three
little bent tubes, shown in the figure, each communicating
with a capsule closed underneath by the membrane.
This is in direct contact with the air of the
organ-pipe. From the three capsules issue the three
little burners, with their flames, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>.</p>

<p>Blowing into the pipe so as to sound its fundamental
note, the three flames are agitated, but the central one is
most so. Lowering the flames so as to render them very
small, and blowing again, the central flame, <i>b</i>, is extinguished,
while the others remain lighted. The experiment
may be performed half a dozen times in succession; the
sounding of the fundamental note always quenches the
middle flame.</p>

<p>By blowing more sharply into the pipe, it is caused
to yield its first overtone. The middle node no longer
exists. The centre of the pipe is now a place of maximum
vibration, while two nodes are formed midway between
the centre and the two ends. But if this be the
case, and if the flame opposite the node be always blown
out, then, when the first overtone of this pipe is sounded,
the two flames <i>a</i> and <i>c</i> ought to be extinguished, while
the central flame remains lighted. This is the case.
When the first harmonic is sounded the two nodal flames
are infallibly extinguished, while the flame <i>b</i> in the middle
of the ventral segment is not sensibly disturbed.</p>

<p>There is no theoretic limit to the subdivision of an
organ-pipe, either stopped or open. In stopped pipes we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
begin with 1 semi-ventral segment, and pass on to 3, 5,
7, etc., semi-ventral segments, the number of vibrations
of the successive notes augmenting in the same ratio. In
open pipes we begin with 2 semi-ventral segments, and
pass on to 4, 6, 8, 10, etc., the number of vibrations of
the successive notes augmenting in the same ratio; that
is to say, in the ratio 1:2:3:4:5, etc. When, therefore,
we pass from the fundamental tone to the first overtone
in an open pipe, we obtain the octave of the fundamental.
<span class="figleft300">
<img src="images/i_230.jpg" width="300" height="352" alt="Fig. 103." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 103.</span></span>
</span>
When we make the
same passage in a stopped
pipe, we obtain a note a
fifth above the octave. No
intermediate modes of vibration
are in either case
possible. If the fundamental
tone of a stopped
pipe be produced by 100
vibrations a second, the
first overtone will be produced
by 300 vibrations,
the second by 500, and so
on. Such a pipe, for example,
cannot execute 200 or 400 vibrations in a second.
In like manner the open pipe, whose fundamental note
is produced by 100 vibrations a second, cannot vibrate 150
times in a second, but passes, at a jump, to 200, 300, 400,
and so on.</p>



<p>In open pipes, as in stopped ones, the number of
vibrations executed in the unit of time is inversely proportional
to the length of the pipe. This follows from
the fact, already dwelt upon so often, that the time of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
vibration is determined by the distance which the sonorous
pulse has to travel to complete a vibration.</p>

<p>In Fig. 103, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> (at the bottom) represent the division
of an open pipe corresponding to its fundamental
tone; <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> represent the division corresponding to its
first, <i>e</i> and <i>f</i> the division corresponding to its second
overtone, the dots marking the nodes. The distance <i>m n</i>
is one-half, <i>o p</i> is one-fourth, and <i>s t</i> is one-sixth of the
whole length of the pipe. But the pitch of <i>a</i> is that of
a stopped pipe equal in length to <i>m n</i>; the pitch of <i>c</i> is
that of a stopped pipe of the length <i>o p</i>; while the pitch
of <i>e</i> is that of a stopped pipe of the length <i>s t</i>. Hence,
as these lengths are in the ratio of 1/2:1/4:1/6, or as 1:1/2:1/3, the
rates of vibration must be as the reciprocals of these, or
as 3:2:1. From the mere inspection, therefore, of the
respective modes of vibration, we can draw the inference
that the succession of tones of an open pipe must correspond
to the series of natural numbers.</p>

<p>The pipe <i>a</i>, Fig. 103, has been purposely drawn twice
the length of <i>a</i>, <a href="#f93">Fig. 93</a> (p. 215). It is perfectly manifest
that to complete a vibration the pulse has to pass over
the same distance in both pipes, and hence that the pitch
of the two pipes must be the same. The open pipe, <i>a n</i>,
consists virtually of two stopped ones, with the central
nodal surface at <i>m</i> as their common base. This shows
the relation of a stopped pipe to an open one to be that
which experiment establishes.</p>


<h3>§ 15. <i>Velocity of Sound in Gases, Liquids, and Solids
determined by Musical Vibrations</i></h3>

<p>We have already learned that the <em>relative</em> velocities of
sound in different solid bodies may be determined from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
the notes which they emit when thrown into longitudinal
vibration. It was remarked at the time that to draw up
a table of <em>absolute</em> velocities we only required the accurate
comparison of the velocity in any one of those solids
with the velocity in air. We are now in a condition to
supply this comparison. For we have learned that the
vibrations of the air in an organ-pipe open at both ends
are executed precisely as those of a rod free at both
ends. Any difference of rapidity, therefore, between the
vibrations of a rod and of an open organ-pipe of the
same length must be due solely to the different velocities
with which the sonorous pulses are propagated through
them. Take therefore an organ-pipe of a certain length,
emitting a note of a certain pitch, and find the length of
a rod of pine which yields the same note. This length
would be ten times that of the organ-pipe, which would
prove the velocity of sound in pine to be ten times its
velocity in air. But the absolute velocity in air is 1,090
feet a second; hence the absolute velocity in pine is
10,900 feet a second, which is that given in our first
chapter (p. 74). To the celebrated Chladni we are indebted
for this beautiful mode of determining the velocity
of sound in solid bodies.</p>

<p>We had also in our first lecture a table of the velocities
of sound in other gases than air. I am persuaded
that you could tell me, after due reflection, how this
table was constructed. It would only be necessary to
find a series of organ-pipes which, when filled with the
different gases, yield the same note; the lengths of these
pipes would give the relative velocities of sound through
the gases. Thus we should find the length of a pipe
filled with hydrogen to be four times that of a pipe filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
with oxygen, yielding the same note, and this would
prove the velocity of sound in the former to be four
times its velocity in the latter.</p>

<p>But we had also a table of velocities through various
liquids. How was it constructed? By forcing the liquids
through properly constructed organ-pipes, and comparing
their musical tones. Thus, in water it requires a pipe a
little better than four feet long to produce the note of an
air-pipe one foot long; and this proves the velocity of
sound in water to be somewhat more than four times its
velocity in air. My object here is to give you a clear
notion of the way in which scientific knowledge enables
us to cope with these apparently insurmountable problems.
It is not necessary to go into the niceties of these
measurements. You will, however, readily comprehend
that all the experiments with gases might be made with
the same organ-pipe, the velocity of sound in each respective
gas being immediately deduced from the pitch of
its note. With a pipe of constant length the pitch, or,
in other words, the number of vibrations, would be
directly proportional to the velocity. Thus, comparing
oxygen with hydrogen, we should find the note of the
latter to be the double octave of that of the former,
whence we should infer the velocity of sound in hydrogen
to be four times its velocity in oxygen. The same
remark applies to experiments with liquids. Here also
the same pipe may be employed throughout, the velocities
being inferred from the notes produced by the respective
liquids.</p>

<p>In fact, the length of an open pipe being, as already
explained, one-half the length of its sonorous wave, it is
only necessary to determine, by means of the siren, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
number of vibrations executed by the pipe in a second,
and to multiply this number by twice the length of the
pipe, in order to obtain the velocity of sound in the gas
or liquid within the pipe. Thus, an open pipe 26 inches
long and filled with air executes 256 vibrations in a
second. The length of its sonorous wave is twice 26
inches, or 4-1/3 feet: multiplying 256 by 4-1/3 we obtain 1,120
feet per second as the velocity of sound through air of
this temperature. Were the tube filled with carbonic-acid
gas, its vibrations would be slower: were it filled
with hydrogen, its vibrations would be quicker; and applying
the same principle, we should find the velocity of
sound in both these gases.</p>

<p>So likewise the length of a solid rod free at both
ends, and sounding its fundamental note, is half that of
the sonorous wave in the substance of the solid. Hence
we have only to determine the rate of vibration of such
a rod, and multiply it by twice the length of the rod, to
obtain the velocity of sound in the substance of the rod.
You can hardly fail to be impressed by the power which
physical science has given us over these problems; nor
will you refuse your admiration to that famous old investigator,
Chladni, who taught us how to master them
experimentally.</p>


<h3>REEDS AND REED-PIPES</h3>

<p>The construction of the siren and our experiments
with that instrument are, no doubt, fresh in your recollection.
Its musical sounds are produced by the cutting up
into puffs of a series of air-currents. The same purpose
is effected by a vibrating reed, as employed in the accor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>dion,
the concertina, and the harmonica. In these instruments
it is not the vibrations of the reed itself which,
imparted to the air, and transmitted through it to our
organs of hearing, produce the music; the function of
the reed is <em>constructive</em>, not <em>generative</em>; it molds into a
series of discontinuous puffs that which without it would
be a continuous current of air.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_235.jpg" width="399" height="191" alt="Fig. 104." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 104.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Reeds, if associated with organ-pipes, sometimes command,
and are sometimes commanded by, the vibrations
of the column of air. When they are stiff they rule the
column; when they are flexible the column rules them.
In the former case, to derive any advantage from the air-column,
its length ought to be so regulated that either its
fundamental tone or one of its overtones shall correspond
to the rate of vibration of the reed. The metal reed
commonly employed in organ-pipes is shown in Fig. 104,
<span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">b</span>, both in perspective and in section. It consists
of a long and flexible strip of metal, <span class="smcap">V V</span>, placed in a
rectangular orifice, through which the current of air
enters the pipe. The manner in which the reed and pipe
are associated is shown in Fig. 105. The front, <i>b c</i>, of
the space containing the flexible tongue is of glass, so
that you may see the tongue within it. A conical pipe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
<span class="smcap">A B</span>, surmounts the reed.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> The wire <i>w i</i>, shown pressing
<span class="figleft150">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 105.</span></span></span>
against the reed, is employed to lengthen or shorten it,
and thus to vary within certain limits its
rate of vibration. At one time in the
practice of music the reed closed the
aperture by simply falling against its
sides; every stroke of the reed produced
a tap, and these linked themselves together
to an unpleasant, screaming sound,
which materially injured that of the associated
organ-pipe. This was mitigated,
but not removed, by permitting the reed
to strike against soft leather; but the
reed now employed is the <em>free reed</em>,
which vibrates to and fro between the
sides of the aperture, almost, but not
quite, filling it. In this way the unpleasantness
referred to is avoided. When
reed and pipe synchronize perfectly, the
sound is most pure and forcible; a certain
latitude, however, is possible on
both sides of perfect synchronism. But
if the discordance be pushed too far, the
pipe ceases to be of any use. We then
obtain the sound due to the vibrations
of the reed alone.</p>



<p>Flexible wooden reeds, which can accommodate themselves
to the requirements of the pipes above them, are
also employed in organ-pipes. Perhaps the simplest illus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>tration
of the action of the reed commanded by its aërial
column is furnished by a common wheaten straw. At
about an inch from a knot, at <i>r</i>, I bury my penknife in
this straw, <i>s r′</i>, Fig. 106, to a depth of about one-fourth
of the straw’s diameter, and, turning the blade flat, pass
it upward toward the knot, thus raising a strip of the
straw nearly an inch in length. This strip, <i>r r′</i>, is to be
our reed, and the straw itself is to be our pipe. It is
now eight inches long. When blown into, it emits this
decidedly musical sound. When cut so as to make its
length six inches, the pitch is higher; with a length of
four inches, the pitch is higher still; and with a length
of two inches, the sound is very shrill indeed. In these
experiments the reed was compelled to accommodate itself
throughout to the requirements of the vibrating
column of air.</p>

</div>

<p>The clarinet is a reed-pipe. It has a single broad
tongue, with which a long, cylindrical tube is associated.
The reed-end of the instrument is grasped by the lips,
and by their pressure the slit between the reed and its
frame is narrowed to the required extent. The overtones
of a clarinet are different from those of a flute. A flute
is an open pipe, a clarinet a stopped one, the end at
which the reed is placed answering to the closed end of
the pipe. The tones of a flute follow the order of the
natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., or of the even numbers
2, 4, 6, 8, etc.; while the tones of a clarinet follow the
order of the odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. The inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>mediate
notes are supplied by opening the lateral orifices
of the instrument. Sir C. Wheatstone was the first to
make known this difference between the flute and clarinet,
and his results agree with the more thorough investigations
of Helmholtz. In the hautboy and bassoon we
have two reeds inclined to each other at a sharp angle,
with a slit between them, through which the air is urged.
The pipe of the hautboy is <em>conical</em>, and its overtones are
those of an open pipe—different, therefore, from those
of a clarinet. The pulpy end of a straw of green corn
may be split by squeezing it, so as to form a double
reed of this kind, and such a straw yields a musical
tone. In the horn, trumpet, and serpent, the performer’s
lips play the part of the reed. These instruments are
formed of long, conical tubes, and their overtones are
those of an open organ-pipe. The music of the older
instruments of this class was limited to their overtones,
the particular tone elicited depending on the force of the
blast and the tension of the lips. It is now usual to fill
the gaps between the successive overtones by means of
keys, which enable the performer to vary the length
of the vibrating column of air.</p>


<h3>§ 16. <i>The Voice</i></h3>

<p>The most perfect of reed instruments is the organ of
voice. The vocal organ in man is placed at the top
of the trachea or wind-pipe, the head of which is adjusted
for the attachment of certain elastic bands which almost
close the aperture. When the air is forced from the
lungs through the slit which separates these <em>vocal chords</em>,
they are thrown into vibration; by varying their tension,
the rate of vibration is varied, and the sound changed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
pitch. The vibrations of the vocal chords are practically
unaffected by the resonance of the mouth, though we
shall afterward learn that this resonance, by reinforcing
one or the other of the tones of the vocal chords, influences
in a striking manner the quality of the voice. The
sweetness and smoothness of the voice depend on the
perfect closure of the slit of the glottis at regular intervals
during the vibration.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_239.jpg" width="175" height="235" alt="Fig. 107." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 107.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The vocal chords may be illuminated and viewed
in a mirror, placed suitably at the
back of the mouth. Varied experiments
of this kind have been executed
by Sig. Garcia.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> I once sought
to project the larynx of M. Czermak
upon a screen in this room, but with
only partial success. The organ may,
however, be viewed directly in the
laryngoscope; its motions, in singing,
speaking, and coughing, being strikingly
visible. It is represented at rest in Fig. 107.
The roughness of the voice in colds is due, according
to Helmholtz, to mucous flocculi, which get into the
slit of the glottis, and which are seen by means of
the laryngoscope. The squeaking falsetto voice, with
which some persons are afflicted, Helmholtz thinks,
may be produced by the drawing aside of the mucous
layer which ordinarily lies under and loads the vocal
chords. Their edges thus become sharper and their
weight less; while, their elasticity remaining the same,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>they are shaken into more rapid tremors. The promptness
and accuracy with which the vocal chords can
change their tension, their form, and the width of
the slit between them, to which must be added the
elective resonance of the cavity of the mouth, render
the voice the most perfect of musical instruments.</p>

<div class="figleft150">
<img src="images/i_240.jpg" width="150" height="168" alt="Fig. 108." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 108.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The celebrated comparative anatomist, John Müller,
imitated the action of the vocal chords by means of
bands of India-rubber. He closed the open end of a
glass tube by two strips of this substance, leaving a slit
between them. On urging air through the slit, the bands
were thrown into vibration, and a
musical tone produced. Helmholtz
recommends the form shown in Fig.
108, where the tube, instead of ending
in a section at right angles to its
axis, terminates in two oblique sections,
over which the bands of India-rubber
are drawn. The easiest mode
of obtaining sounds from reeds of this character is to
roll round the end of a glass tube a strip of thin India-rubber,
leaving about an inch of the substance projecting
beyond the end of the tube. Taking two opposite portions
of the projecting rubber in the fingers, and stretching
it, a slit is formed, the blowing through which produces
a musical sound, which varies in pitch, as the
sides of the slit vary in tension.</p>


<h3>§ 17. <i>Vowel Sounds</i></h3>

<p>The formation of the vowel sounds of the human
voice excited long ago philosophic inquiry. We can
distinguish one vowel sound from another, while assign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>ing
to both the same pitch and intensity. What, then,
is the quality which renders the distinction possible? In
the year 1779 this was made a prize question by the
Academy of St. Petersburg, and Kratzenstein gained
the prize for the successful manner in which he imitated
the vowel sounds by mechanical arrangements. At
the same time Von Kempelen, of Vienna, made similar
and more elaborate experiments. The question was subsequently
taken up by Mr. Willis, who succeeded beyond
all his predecessors in the experimental treatment of the
subject. The true theory of vowel sounds was first
stated by Sir C. Wheatstone, and quite recently they
have been made the subject of exhaustive inquiry by
Helmholtz. You will find little difficulty in comprehending
their origin.</p>

<p>Mounted on the acoustic bellows, without any pipe
associated with it, when air is urged through its orifice,
a free reed speaks in this forcible manner. When upon
the frame of the reed a pyramidal pipe is fixed, you
notice a change in the sound; and by pushing my flat
hand over the open end of the pipe, the similarity between
the sound produced and that of the human voice
is unmistakable. Holding the palm of the hand over
the end of the pipe so as to close it altogether, and then
raising the hand twice in quick succession, the word
“mamma” is heard as plainly as if it were uttered by
an infant. For this pyramidal tube I now substitute a
shorter one, and with it make the same experiment. The
“mamma” now heard is exactly such as would be uttered
by a child with a stopped nose. Thus, by associating
with a vibrating reed a suitable pipe, we can impart
to the sound the qualities of the human voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span></p>

<p>In the organ of voice, the reed is formed by the vocal
chords, and associated with this reed is the resonant cavity
of the mouth, which can so alter its shape as to
resound, at will, either to the fundamental tone of the
vocal chords or to any of their overtones. With the aid
of the mouth, therefore, we can <em>mix together</em> the fundamental
tone and the overtones of the voice in different
proportions. Different vowel sounds are due to different
admixtures of this kind. Striking one of this series of
tuning-forks, and placing it before my mouth, I adjust
the size of that cavity until it resounds forcibly to the
fork. Then, without altering in the least the shape or
size of my mouth, I urge air through the glottis. The
vowel sound “<span class="smcap">U</span>” (<i>oo</i> in hoop) is produced, and no
other. I strike another fork, and, placing it in front
of the mouth, adjust the cavity to resonance. Then removing
the fork and urging air through the glottis, the
vowel sound “<span class="smcap">O</span>,” and it only, is heard. I strike a third
fork, adjust my mouth to it, and then urge air through
the larynx; the vowel sound <em>ah!</em> and no other, is heard.
In all these cases the vocal chords have been in the
same constant condition. They have generated throughout
the same fundamental tone and the same overtones,
the changes of sound which you have heard being due
solely to the fact that different tones in the different
cases were reinforced by the resonance of the mouth.
Donders first proved that the mouth resounded differently
for the different vowels.</p>

<p>In the formation of the different vowel sounds the
resonant cavity of the mouth undergoes, according to
Helmholtz, the following changes:</p>

<p>For the production of the sound “<span class="smcap">U</span>” (<em>oo</em> in hoop),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
the lips must be pushed forward, so as to make the
cavity of the mouth as deep as possible, and the orifice
of the mouth, by the contraction of the lips, as small
as possible. This arrangement corresponds to the deepest
resonance of which the mouth is capable. The fundamental
tone itself of the vocal chords is here reinforced,
while the higher tones retreat.</p>

<p>The vowel “<span class="smcap">O</span>” requires a somewhat wider opening of
the mouth. The overtones which lie in the neighborhood
of the middle <i>b</i> of the soprano come out strongly in the
case of this vowel.</p>

<p>When “Ah” is sounded, the mouth assumes the shape
of a funnel, widening outward. It is thus tuned to a
note an octave higher than in the case of the vowel “<span class="smcap">O</span>.”
Hence, in sounding “Ah,” those overtones are most
strengthened which lie near the higher <i>b</i> of the soprano.
As the mouth is in this case wide open, all the other
overtones are also heard, though feebly.</p>

<p>In sounding “<span class="smcap">A</span>” and “<span class="smcap">E</span>,” the hinder part of the
mouth is deepened, while the front of the tongue rises
against the gums and forms a tube; this yields a higher
resonance-tone, rising gradually from “<span class="smcap">A</span>” to “<span class="smcap">E</span>,” while
the hinder hollow space yields a lower resonance-tone,
which is deepest when “<span class="smcap">E</span>” is sounded.</p>

<p>These examples sufficiently illustrate the subject of
vowel sounds. We may blend in various ways the elementary
tints of the solar spectrum, producing innumerable
composite colors by their admixture. Out of violet
and red we produce purple, and out of yellow and blue
we produce white. Thus also may elementary sounds be
blended so as to produce all possible varieties of clang-tint.
After having resolved the human voice into its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
constituent tones, Helmholtz was able to imitate these
tones by tuning-forks, and, by combining them appropriately
together, to produce the sounds of all the vowels.</p>


<h3>§ 18. <i>Kundt’s Experiments: New Modes of determining
Velocity of Sound</i></h3>

<p>Unwilling to interrupt the continuity of our reasonings
and experiments on the sound of organ-pipes, and
their relations to the vibrations of solid rods, I have
reserved for the conclusion of this discourse some reflections
and experiments which, in strictness, belong to an
earlier portion of the chapter. You have already heard
the tones, and made yourselves acquainted with the various
modes of division of a glass tube, free at both ends,
when thrown into longitudinal vibration. When it sounds
its fundamental tone, you know that the two halves of
such a tube lengthen and shorten in quick alternation.
If the tube were stopped at its ends, the closed extremities
would throw the air within the tube into a state of
vibration; and if the velocity of sound in air were equal
to its velocity in glass, the air of the tube would vibrate
in synchronism with the tube itself. But the velocity of
sound in air is far less than its velocity in glass, and
hence, if the column of air is to synchronize with the
vibrations of the tube, it can only do so by dividing
itself into vibrating segments of a suitable length. In an
investigation of great interest, recently published in “Poggendorff’s
Annalen,” M. Kundt, of Berlin, has taught us
how these segments may be rendered visible. Into this
six-foot tube is introduced the light powder of lycopodium,
being shaken all over the interior surface. A small
quantity of the powder clings to that surface. Stopping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
the ends of the tube, holding its centre by a fixed clamp,
and sweeping a wet cloth briskly over one of its halves,
instantly the powder, which a moment ago clung to its
interior surface, falls to the bottom of the tube in the
forms shown in Fig. 109, the arrangement of the lycopodium
marking the manner in which the column of air has
been divided. Every node here is encircled by a ring of
dust, while from node to node the dust arranges itself in
transverse streaks along the ventral segments.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_245.jpg" width="400" height="70" alt="Fig. 109." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 109.</span></div>
</div>

<p>You will have little difficulty in seeing that we perform
here, with air, substantially the same experiment as
that of M. Melde with a vibrating string. When the
string was too long to vibrate as a whole, it met the requirements
of the tuning-fork to which it was attached
by dividing into ventral segments. Now, in all cases,
the length from a node to its next neighbor is half that
of the sonorous wave: how many such half-waves then
have we in our tube in the present instance? Sixteen
(the figure shows only four of them). But the length of
our glass tube vibrating thus longitudinally is also half
that of the sonorous wave <em>in glass</em>. Hence, in the case
before us, with the same rate of vibration, the length of
the semi-wave in glass is sixteen times the length
of the semi-wave in air. In other words, the velocity of
sound in glass is sixteen times its velocity in air. Thus,
by a single sweep of the wet rubber, we solve a most
important problem. But, as M. Kundt has shown, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
need not confine ourselves to air. Introducing any other
gas into the tube, a single stroke of our wet cloth enables
us to determine the relative velocity of sound in that gas
and in glass. When hydrogen is introduced, the number
of ventral segments is less than in air; when carbonic
acid is introduced, the number is greater.</p>

<p>From the known velocity of sound in air, coupled
with the length of one of these dust segments, we can
immediately deduce the number of vibrations executed
in a second by the tube itself. Clasping a glass tube at
its centre and drawing my wetted cloth over one of its
halves, I elicit this shrill note. The length of every dust
segment, now within the tube, is 3 inches. Hence the
length of the aërial sonorous wave corresponding to this
note is 6 inches. But the velocity of sound in air of our
present temperature is 1,120 feet per second; a distance
which would embrace 2,240 of our sonorous waves. This
number, therefore, expresses the number of vibrations per
second executed by the glass tube now before us.</p>

<p>Instead of damping the centre of the tube, and making
it a nodal point, we may employ any other of its subdivisions.
Laying hold of it, for example, at a point
midway between its centre and one of its ends, and rubbing
it properly, it divides into three vibrating parts,
separated by two nodes. We know that in this division
the note elicited is the octave of that heard when a single
node is formed at the middle of the tube; for the vibrations
are twice as rapid. If therefore we divide the tube,
having air within it, by two nodes instead of one, the
number of ventral segments revealed by the lycopodium
dust will be thirty-two instead of sixteen. The same
remark applies, of course, to all other gases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span></p>

<p>Filling a series of four tubes with air, carbonic acid,
coal-gas, and hydrogen, and then rubbing each so as to
produce two nodes, M. Kundt found the number of dust
segments formed within the tube in the respective cases
to be as follows:</p>


<table summary="dust segments"><tr>
<td class="tdl">Air</td><td class="tdr">32</td><td class="tdc">dust segments</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdl padr15">Carbonic acid</td><td class="tdr">40</td><td class="tdc">”</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdl">Coal-gas</td><td class="tdr">20</td><td class="tdc">”</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdl">Hydrogen</td><td class="tdr">9</td><td class="tdc">”</td></tr></table>

<p>Calling the velocity in air unity, the following fractions
express the ratio of this velocity to those in the
other gases:</p>

<table class="table2" summary="ratios" border="0"><tr>

<p>Referring to a table introduced in our first chapter, we
learn that Dulong by a totally different mode of experiment
found the velocity in carbonic acid to be 0.86, and
in hydrogen 3·8 times the velocity in air. The results of
Dulong were deduced from the sounds of organ-pipes
filled with the various gases; but here, by a process of
the utmost simplicity, we arrive at a close approximation
to his results. Dusting the interior surfaces of our tubes,
filling them with the proper gases, and sealing their ends,
they may be preserved for an indefinite time. By properly
shaking one of them at any moment, its inner surface
becomes thinly coated with the dust; and afterward a
single stroke of the wet cloth produces the division from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
which the velocity of sound in the gas may be immediately
inferred. Savart found that a spiral nodal
line is formed round a tube or rod when it vibrates
longitudinally, and Seebeck showed that
this line was produced, not by longitudinal, but
by secondary transverse vibrations. Now this
spiral nodal line tends to complicate the division
of the dust in our present experiments. It is,
therefore, desirable to operate in a manner which
shall altogether avoid the formation of this line;
M. Kundt has accomplished this, by exciting the
longitudinal vibrations in one tube, and producing
the division into ventral segments in another,
into which the first fits like a piston. Before you
is a tube of glass, Fig. 110, seven feet long, and
two inches internal diameter. One end of this
tube is filled by the movable stopper <i>b</i>. The
other end, <span class="smcap">K K</span>, is also stopped by a cork, through
the centre of which passes the narrower tube <span class="smcap">A</span> <i>a</i>,
which is firmly clasped at its middle by the cork,
<span class="smcap">K K</span>. The end of the interior tube, <span class="smcap">A</span> <i>a</i>, is also
closed with a projecting stopper, <i>a</i>, almost sufficient
to fill the larger tube, but still fitting into
it so loosely that the friction of <i>a</i> against the interior
surface is too slight to interfere practically
with its vibrations. The interior surface between
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i> being lightly coated with the lycopodium
dust, a wet cloth is passed briskly over <span class="smcap">A K</span>;
instantly the dust between <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> divides into
a number of ventral segments. When the length
of the column of air, <i>a b</i>, is equal to that of
the glass tube, <span class="smcap">A</span> <i>a</i>, the number of ventral segments is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
sixteen. When, as in the figure, <i>a b</i> is only one-half the
length of <span class="smcap">A</span> <i>a</i>, the number of ventral segments is eight.</p>

<p>But here you must perceive that the method of experiment
is capable of great extension. Instead of the
glass tube, <span class="smcap">A</span> <i>a</i>, we may employ a rod of any other solid
substance—of wood or metal, for example, and thus determine
the relative velocity of sound in the solid and in
air. In the place of the glass tube, for example, a rod
of brass of equal length may be employed. Rubbing its
external half by a resined cloth, it divides the column
<i>a b</i> into the number of ventral segments proper to the
metal’s rate of vibrations. In this way M. Kundt operated
with brass, steel, glass, and copper, and his results
prove the method to be capable of great accuracy. Calling,
as before, the velocity of sound in air unity, the following
numbers expressive of the ratio of the velocity
of sound in brass to its velocity in air were obtained in
three different series of experiments:</p>

<table summary="experiments"><tr>
<td class="tdl padr15">1st experiment</td><td>10·87</td></tr><tr>
<td>2d experiment</td><td>10·87</td></tr><tr>
<td>3d experiment</td><td>10·86</td></tr></table>


<p>The coincidence is here extraordinary. To illustrate
the possible accuracy of the method, the length of the
individual dust segments was measured. In a series of
twenty-seven experiments, this length was found to vary
between 43 and 44 millimètres (each millimètre 1/25th of an
inch), never rising so high as the latter and never falling
so low as the former. The length of the metal rod, compared
with that of one of the segments capable of this
accurate measurement, gives us at once the velocity of
sound in the metal, as compared with its velocity in air.</p>

<p>Three distinct experiments, performed in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
manner on steel, gave the following velocities, the velocity
through air, as before, being regarded as unity:</p>

<table summary="experiments"><tr>
<td class="tdl padr15">1st experiment</td><td>15·34</td></tr><tr>
<td>2d experiment</td><td>15·33</td></tr><tr>
<td>3d experiment</td><td>15·34</td></tr></table>


<p>Here the coincidence is quite as perfect as in the case
of brass.</p>

<p>In glass, by this new mode of experiment, the velocity
was found to be</p>

<p class="center">15·25.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<p>Finally, in copper the velocity was found to be</p>

<p class="center">11·96.</p>



<p>These results agree extremely well with those obtained
by other methods. Wertheim, for example, found the
velocity of sound in steel wire to be 15·108; M. Kundt
finds it to be 15·34: Wertheim also found the velocity
in copper to be 11·17; M. Kundt finds it to be 11·96.
The differences are not greater than might be produced
by differences in the materials employed by the two
experimenters.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 111.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The length of the aërial column may or may not be
an exact multiple of the wave-length, corresponding to
the rod’s rate of vibration. If not, the dust segments
usually take the form shown in Fig. 111. But if, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>means of the stopper, <i>b</i>, the column of air be made an
exact multiple of the wave-length, then the dust quits
the vibrating segments altogether, and forms, as in Fig.
112, little isolated heaps at the nodes.</p>


<h3>§ 19. <i>Explanation of a Difficulty</i></h3>

<p>And here a difficulty presents itself. The stopped end
<i>b</i> of the tube <a href="#f110">Fig. 110</a> is, of course, a place of no vibration,
where in all cases a nodal dust-heap is formed; but,
whenever the column of air was an exact multiple of the
wave-length, M. Kundt always found a dust-heap close to
the end <i>a</i> of the vibrating rod also. Thus the point
from which all the vibration emanated seemed itself to
be a place of no vibration.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_251.jpg" width="400" height="60" alt="Fig. 112." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 112.</span></div>
</div>

<p>This difficulty was pointed out by M. Kundt, but he
did not attempt its solution. We are now in a condition
to explain it. In Lecture III. it was remarked that in
strictness a node is not a place of no vibration; that it is
a place of <em>minimum</em> vibration; and that, by the addition
of the minute pulses which the node permits, vibrations
of vast amplitude may be produced. The ends of M.
Kundt’s tube are such points of minimum motion, the
lengths of the vibrating segments being such that, by
the coalescence of direct and reflected pulses, the air at
a distance of half a ventral segment from the end of the
tube vibrates much more vigorously than that at the end
of the tube itself. This addition of impulses is more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
perfect when the aërial column is an exact multiple of
the wave-length, and hence it is that, in this case, the
vibrations become sufficiently intense to sweep the dust
altogether away from the vibrating segments. The same
point is illustrated by M. Melde’s tuning-forks, which,
though they are the sources of all the motion, are themselves
nodes.</p>

<p>An experiment of Helmholtz’s is here capable of instructive
application. Upon the string of the sonometer
described in our third lecture I place the iron stem of
this tuning-fork, which executes 512 complete vibrations
in a second. At present you hear no augmentation of
the sound of the fork; the string remains quiescent. But
on moving the fork along the string, at the number 33, a
loud, swelling note issues from the string. At this particular
tension the length 33 exactly synchronizes with
the vibrations of the fork. By the intermediation of the
string, therefore, the fork is enabled to transfer its motion
to the sonometer, and through it to the air. The
sound continues as long as the fork vibrates, but the
least movement to the right or to the left from this
point causes a sudden fall of the sound. Tightening the
string, the note disappears; for it requires a greater
length of this more highly tensioned string to respond
to the fork. But, on moving the fork further away, at
the number 36 the note again bursts forth. Tightening
still more, 40 is found to be the point of maximum
power. When the string is slackened, it must, of course,
be shortened in order to make it respond to the fork.
Moving the fork now toward the end of the string, at
the number 25 the note is found as before. Again, shifting
the fork to 35, nothing is heard; but, by the cau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>tious
turning of the key, the point of synchronism, if I
may use the term, is moved further from the end of the
string. It finally reaches the fork, and at that moment a
clear, full note issues from the sonometer. In all cases,
before the exact point is attained, and immediately in its
vicinity, we hear “beats,” which, as we shall afterward
understand, are due to the coalescence of the sound of
the fork with that of the string, when they are nearly,
but not quite, in unison with each other.</p>

<p>In these experiments, though the fork was the source
of all the motion, <em>the point on which it rested was a nodal
point</em>. It constituted the comparatively fixed extremity of
the wire, whose vibrations synchronized with those of the
fork. The case is exactly analogous to that of the hand
holding the India-rubber tube, and to the tuning-fork in
the experiments of M. Melde. It is also an effect precisely
the same in kind as that observed by M. Kundt,
where the part of the column of air in contact with the
end of his vibrating rod proved to be a node instead
of the middle of a ventral segment.</p>


<h3>ADDENDUM REGARDING RESONANCE</h3>

<p>The resonance of caves and of rocky inclosures is well
known. Bunsen notices the thunder-like sound produced
when one of the steam jets of Iceland breaks out near
the mouth of a cavern. Most travellers in Switzerland
have noticed the deafening sound produced by the fall
of the Reuss at the Devil’s Bridge. The sound heard
when a hollow shell is placed close to the ear is a case
of resonance. Children think they hear in it the sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
of the sea. The noise is really due to the reinforcement
of the feeble sounds with which even the stillest
air is pervaded, and also in part to the noise produced
by the pressure of the shell against the ear itself. By
using tubes of different lengths, the variation of the resonance
with the length of the tube may be studied.
The channel of the ear itself is also a resonant cavity.
When a poker is held by two strings, and when the
fingers of the hands holding the poker are thrust into
the ears on striking the poker against a piece of wood,
a sound is heard as deep and sonorous as that of a
cathedral bell. When open, the channel of the ear resounds
to notes whose periods of vibration are about
3,000 per second. This has been shown by Helmholtz,
and Madame Seiler has found that dogs which howl to
music are particularly sensitive to the same notes. We
may expect from Mr. Francis Galton interesting results
in connection with this subject.</p>


<h3>SUMMARY OF CHAPTER V</h3>

<p>When a stretched wire is suitably rubbed, in the
direction of its length, it is thrown into longitudinal
vibrations: the wire can either vibrate as a whole or
divide itself into vibrating segments separated from each
other by nodes.</p>

<p>The tones of such a wire follow the order of the
numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.</p>

<p>The <em>transverse</em> vibrations of a rod fixed at both ends
do not follow the same order as the transverse vibrations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
of a stretched wire; for here the forces brought into
play, as explained in Lecture IV., are different. But
the longitudinal vibrations of a stretched wire do follow
the same order as the longitudinal vibrations of a rod
fixed at both ends, for here the forces brought into play
are the same, being in both cases the elasticity of the
material.</p>

<p>A rod fixed at one end vibrates longitudinally as a
whole, or it divides into two, three, four, etc., vibrating
parts, separated from each other by nodes. The order of
the tones of such a rod is that of the odd numbers
1, 3, 5, 7, etc.</p>

<p>A rod free at both ends can also vibrate longitudinally.
Its lowest note corresponds to a division of the
rod into two vibrating parts by a node at its centre.
The overtones of such a rod correspond to its division
into three, four, five, etc., vibrating parts, separated from
each other by two, three, four, etc., nodes. The order
of the tones of such a rod is that of the numbers
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.</p>

<p>We may also express the order by saying that while
the tones of a rod fixed at both ends follow the order
of the odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, etc., the tones of a rod
free at both ends follow the order of the even numbers
2, 4, 6, 8, etc.</p>

<p>At the points of maximum vibration the rod suffers
no change of density; at the nodes, on the contrary, the
changes of density reach a maximum. This may be
proved by the action of the rod upon polarized light.</p>

<p>Columns of air of definite length resound to tuning-forks
of definite rates of vibration.</p>

<p>The length of a tube filled with air, and closed at one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
end, which resounds to a fork is one-fourth of the length
of the sonorous wave produced by the fork.</p>

<p>This resonance is due to the synchronism which exists
between the vibrating period of the fork and that of the
column of air.</p>

<p>By blowing across the mouth of a tube closed at one
end, we produce a flutter of the air, and some pulse of
this flutter may be raised by the resonance of the tube
to a musical sound.</p>

<p>The sound is the same as that obtained when a tuning-fork,
whose rate of vibration is that of the tube, is
placed over the mouth of the tube.</p>

<p>When a tube closed at one end—a stopped organ-pipe,
for example—sounds its lowest note, the column of
air within it is undivided by a node. The overtones
of such a column correspond to its division into parts,
like those of a rod fixed at one end and vibrating longitudinally.
The order of its tones is that of the odd numbers
1, 3, 5, 7, etc. That this must be the order follows
from the manner in which the column is divided.</p>

<p>In organ-pipes the air is agitated by causing it to
issue from a narrow slit, and to strike upon a cutting
edge. Some pulse of the flutter thus produced is raised
by the resonance of the pipe to a musical sound.</p>

<p>When, instead of the aërial flutter, a tuning-fork of
the proper rate of vibration is placed at the embouchure
of an organ-pipe, the pipe <em>speaks</em> in response to the fork.
In practice, the organ-pipe virtually creates its own
tuning-fork, by compelling the sheet of air at its embouchure
to vibrate in periods synchronous with its own.</p>

<p>An open organ-pipe yields a note an octave higher
than that of a closed pipe of the same length. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
relation is a necessary consequence of the respective
modes of vibration.</p>

<p>When, for example, a stopped organ-pipe sounds its
deepest note, the column of air, as already explained, is
undivided. When an open pipe sounds its deepest note,
the column is divided by a node at its centre. The open
pipe in this case virtually consists of two stopped pipes
with a common base. Hence it is plain that the fundamental
note of an open pipe must be the same as that of
a stopped pipe of half its length.</p>

<p>The length of a stopped pipe is one-fourth that of the
sonorous wave which it produces, while the length of an
open pipe is one-half that of its sonorous wave.</p>

<p>The order of the tones of an open pipe is that of the
even numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, etc., or of the natural numbers
1, 2, 3, 4, etc.</p>

<p>In both stopped and open pipes the number of vibrations
executed in a given time is inversely proportional
to the length of the pipe.</p>

<p>The places of maximum vibration in organ-pipes are
places of minimum changes of density; while at the places
of minimum vibration the changes of density reach a
maximum.</p>

<p>The velocities of sound in gases, liquids, and solids
may be inferred from the tones which equal lengths of
them produce; or they may be inferred from the lengths
of these substances which yield equal tones.</p>

<p>Reeds, or vibrating tongues, are often associated with
vibrating columns of air. They consist of flexible laminæ,
which vibrate to and fro in a rectangular orifice,
thus rendering intermittent the air-current passing
through the orifice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span></p>

<p>The action of the reed is the same as that of the
siren.</p>

<p>The flexible wooden reeds sometimes associated with
organ-pipes are compelled to vibrate in unison with the
column of air in the pipe; other reeds are too stiff to be
thus controlled by the vibrating air. In this latter case
the column of air is taken of such a length that its vibrations
synchronize with those of the reed.</p>

<p>By associating suitable pipes with reeds we impart to
their tones the qualities of the human voice.</p>

<p>The vocal organ in man is a reed instrument, the vibrating
reed in this case being elastic bands placed at
the top of the trachea, and capable of various degrees
of tension.</p>

<p>The rate of vibration of these vocal chords is practically
uninfluenced by the resonance of the mouth; but
the mouth, by changing its shape, can be caused to resound
to the fundamental tone, or to any of the overtones
of the vocal chords.</p>

<p>By the strengthening of particular tones through the
resonance of the mouth, the clang-tint of the voice is
altered.</p>

<p>The different vowel-sounds are produced by different
admixtures of the fundamental tone and the overtones of
the vocal chords.</p>

<p>When the solid substance of a tube stopped at one, or
at both ends, is caused to vibrate longitudinally, the air
within it is also thrown into vibration.</p>

<p>By covering the interior surface of the tube with a
light powder, the manner in which the aërial column
divides itself may be rendered apparent. From the division
of the column the velocity of sound in the substance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
of the tube, compared with its velocity in air, may be
inferred.</p>

<p>Other gases may be employed instead of air, and the
velocity of sound in these gases, compared with its velocity
in the substance of the tube, may be determined.</p>

<p>The end of a rod vibrating longitudinally may be
caused to agitate a column of air contained in a tube,
compelling the air to divide itself into ventral segments.
These segments may be rendered visible by light powders,
and from them the velocity of sound in the substance of
the vibrating rod, compared with its velocity in air, may
be inferred.</p>

<p>In this way the relative velocities of sound in all solid
substances capable of being formed into rods, and of vibrating
longitudinally, may be determined.</p>

<h3>§ 1. <i>Rhythm of Friction: Musical Flow of a Liquid
through a Small Aperture</i></h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>RICTION is always rhythmic. When a resined bow
is passed across a string, the tension of the string
secures the perfect rhythm of the friction. When
the wetted finger is moved round the edge of a glass,
the breaking up of the friction into rhythmic pulses expresses
itself in music. Savart’s beautiful experiments on
the flow of liquids through small orifices bear immediately
upon this question. We have here the means of
verifying his results. The tube <span class="smcap">A B</span>, Fig. 113, is filled
with water, its extremity, <span class="smcap">B</span>, being closed by a plate of
brass, which is pierced by a circular orifice of a diameter
equal to the thickness of the plate. Removing a little
peg which stops the orifice, the water issues from it, and
as it sinks in the tube a musical note of great sweetness
issues from the liquid column. This note is due to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
intermittent flow of the liquid through the orifice, by
which the whole column above it is thrown into vibration.
The tendency to this effect shows itself when tea
is poured from a teapot, in the circular ripples that cover
the falling liquid. The same intermittence is observed in
the black, dense smoke which rolls in rhythmic rings
from the funnel of a steamer. The unpleasant noise of
unoiled machinery is also a declaration
of the fact that the friction is not uniform,
but is due to the alternate “bite”
and release of the rubbing surfaces.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_261.jpg" width="150" height="372" alt="Fig. 113." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 113.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Where gases are concerned, friction
is of the same intermittent character.
A rifle-bullet sings in its passage
through the air; while to the rubbing
of the wind against the boles and
branches of the trees are to be ascribed
the “waterfall tones” of an agitated
pine-wood. Pass a steadily-burning
candle rapidly through the air; an
indented band of light, declaring intermittence,
is often the consequence,
while the almost musical sound which
accompanies the appearance of this
band is the audible expression of the rhythm. On the
other hand, if you blow gently against a candle-flame,
the fluttering noise announces a rhythmic action. We
have already learned what can be done when a pipe is
associated with such a flutter; we have learned that the
pipe selects a special pulse from the flutter, and raises it
by resonance to a musical sound. In a similar manner
the noise of a flame may be turned to account. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
blow-pipe flame of our laboratory, for example, when
inclosed within an appropriate tube, has its flutter raised
to a <em>roar</em>. The special pulse first selected soon reacts
upon the flame so as to abolish in a great degree the
other pulses, compelling the flame to vibrate in periods
answering to the selected one. And this reaction can
become so powerful—the timed shock of the reflected
pulses may accumulate to such an extent—as to beat the
flame, even when very large, into extinction.</p>


<h3>§ 2. <i>Musical Flames</i></h3>

<p>Nor is it necessary to produce this flutter by any extraneous
means. When a gas-flame is simply inclosed
within a tube, the passage of the air over it is usually
sufficient to produce the necessary rhythmic action, so
as to cause the flame to burst spontaneously into song.
This flame-music may be rendered exceedingly intense.
Over a flame issuing from a ring burner with twenty-eight
orifices, I place a tin tube 5 feet long and 2-1/2
inches in diameter. The flame flutters at first, but it
soon chastens its impulses into perfect periodicity, and
a deep and clear musical tone is the result. By lowering
the gas the note now sounded is caused to cease, but,
after a momentary interval of silence, another note, which
is the octave of the last, is yielded by the flame. The
first note was the fundamental note of the surrounding
tube; this second note is its first harmonic. Here, as in
the case of open organ-pipes, we have the aërial column
dividing itself into vibrating segments, separated from
each other by nodes.</p>



<p><span class="figleft250">
<img src="images/i_263.jpg" width="250" height="791" alt="Fig. 114." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 114.</span></span>
</span>A still more striking effect is obtained with this larger
tube, <i>a b</i>, Fig. 114, 15 feet long and 4 inches wide,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
which was made for a totally different
purpose. It is supported by a steady
stand, <i>s s′</i>, and into it is lifted the tall
burner, shown enlarged at <span class="smcap">B</span>. You hear
the incipient flutter: you now hear the
more powerful sound. As the flame is
lifted higher the action becomes more violent,
until finally a storm of music issues
from the tube. And now all has suddenly
ceased; the reaction of its own
pulses upon the flame has beaten it into
extinction. I relight the flame and make
it very small. When raised within the
tube, the flame again sings, but it is one
of the harmonics of the tube that you
now hear. On turning the gas fully on,
the note ceases—all is silent for a moment;
but the storm is brewing, and soon
it bursts forth, as at first in a kind of
hurricane of sound. By
lowering the flame the fundamental
note is abolished,
and now you hear the first
harmonic of the tube. Making
the flame still smaller,
the first harmonic disappears,
and the second is
heard.  Your ears being
disciplined to the apprehension
of these sounds, I turn
the gas once more fully on.
Mingling with the deepest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
note you notice the harmonics, as if struggling to be
heard amid the general uproar of the flame. With a
large Bunsen’s rose burner, the sound of this tube becomes
powerful enough to shake the floor and seats, and
the large audience that occupies the seats of this room,
while the extinction of the flame, by the reaction of the
<span class="figleft275">
<img src="images/i_264.jpg" width="275" height="462" alt="Fig. 115." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 115.</span></span>
</span>
sonorous pulses, announces
itself by an explosion almost
as loud as a pistol-shot.
It must occur to
you that a chimney is a
tube of this kind upon
a large scale, and that
the roar of a flame in a
chimney is simply a rough
attempt at music.</p>



<p>Let us now pass on to
shorter tubes and smaller
flames. Placing tubes of
different lengths over
eight small flames, each
of them starts into song,
and you notice that as
the tubes lengthen the
tones deepen. The lengths
of these tubes are so
chosen that they yield in succession the eight notes
of the gamut. Round some of them you observe a
paper slider, <i>s</i>, Fig. 115, by which the tube can be
lengthened or shortened. If while the flame is sounding
the slider be raised, the pitch instantly falls; if lowered,
the pitch rises. These experiments prove the flame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
to be governed by the tube. By the reaction of the
pulses, reflected back upon the flame, its flutter is rendered
perfectly periodic, the length of that period being
determined, as in the case of organ-pipes, by the length
of the tube.</p>



<p>The fixed stars, especially those near the horizon,
shine with an unsteady light, sometimes changing color
as they twinkle. I have often watched at night, upon
the plateaux of the Alps, the alternate flash of ruby and
emerald in the lower and larger stars. If you place a
piece of looking-glass so that you can see in it the
image of such a star, on tilting the glass quickly to and
<span class="figright200">
<img src="images/i_265.jpg" width="200" height="138" alt="Fig. 116." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 116.</span></span>
</span>
fro, the line of light obtained
will not be continuous, but will
form a string of colored beads
of extreme beauty.  The same
effect is obtained when an opera-glass
is pointed to the star and
shaken. This experiment shows
that in the act of twinkling the
light of the star is quenched at intervals; the dark spaces
between the bright beads corresponding to the periods of
extinction. Now, our singing flame is a <em>twinkling</em> flame.
When it begins to sing you observe a certain quivering
motion which may be analyzed with a looking-glass, or
an opera-glass, as in the case of the star.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> I can now
see the image of this flame in a small looking-glass. On
tilting the glass, so as to cause the image to form a circle
of light, the luminous band is not seen to be continuous,
as it would be if the flame were perfectly steady;
it is resolved into a beautiful chain of flames, Fig. 116.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span></p>

<h3>§ 3. <i>Experimental Analysis of Musical Flame</i></h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_266.jpg" width="350" height="528" alt="Fig. 117." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 117.</span></div>
</div>

<p>With a larger, brighter, and less rapidly-vibrating
flame, you may all see this intermittent action.  Over
this gas-flame, <i>f</i>, Fig. 117, is placed a glass tube, <span class="smcap">A B</span>, 6
feet long and 2 inches in diameter. The back of the
tube is blackened, so as to prevent the light of the flame
from falling directly upon the screen, which it is now desirable
to have as dark as possible. In front of the tube
is placed a concave mirror, <span class="smcap">M</span>, which forms upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
screen an enlarged image of the flame. I turn the mirror
with my hand and cause the image to pass over the
screen. Were the flame silent and steady, we should
obtain a <em>continuous</em> band of light; but it quivers, and
emits at the same time a deep and powerful note. On
twirling the mirror, therefore, we obtain, instead of a continuous
band, a luminous chain of images. By fast turning,
these images are drawn more widely apart; by slow
turning, they are caused to close up, the chain of flames
passing through the most beautiful variations. Clasping
the lower end, <span class="smcap">B</span>, of the tube with my hand, I so impede
the air as to stop the flame’s vibration; a continuous
band is the consequence. Observe the suddenness with
which this band breaks up into a rippling line of images
the moment my hand is removed and the current of air
is permitted to pass over the flame.</p>


<h3>§ 4. <i>Rate of Vibration of Flame: Toepler’s Experiment</i></h3>

<p>When a <em>small</em> vibrating coal-gas flame is carefully examined
by the rotating mirror, the beaded line is a series
of yellow-tipped flames, each resting upon a base of the
richest blue. In some cases I have been unable to observe
any union of one flame with another; the spaces
between the flames being absolutely dark to the eye. But
if dark, the flame must have been totally extinguished at
intervals, a residue of heat, however, remaining sufficient
to reignite the gas. This is at least possible, for gas may
be ignited by non-luminous air.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> By means of the siren,
we can readily determine the number of times this flame
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>extinguishes and relights itself in a second. As the note
of the instrument approaches that of the flame, unison is
preceded by these well-known beats, which become gradually
less rapid, and now the two notes melt into perfect
unison. Maintaining the siren at this pitch for a minute,
at the end of that time I find recorded upon our dials
1,700 revolutions. But the disk being perforated by 16
holes, it follows that every revolution corresponds to
16 pulses. Multiplying 1,700 by 16, we find the number
of pulses in a minute to be 27,200. This number of
times did our little flame extinguish and rekindle itself
during the continuance of the experiment; that is to say,
it was put out and relighted 453 times in a second.</p>

<p>A flash of light, though instantaneous, makes an impression
upon the retina which endures for the tenth of a
second or more. A flying rifle-bullet, illuminated by a
single flash of lightning, would seem to stand still in the
air for the tenth of a second. A black disk with radial
white strips, when rapidly rotated, causes the white and
black to blend to an impure gray; while a spark of electricity,
or a flash of lightning, reduces the disk to apparent
stillness, the white radial strips being for a time
plainly seen. Now, the singing flame is a flashing flame,
and M. Toepler has shown that by causing a striped disk
to rotate at the proper speed in the presence of such a
flame it is brought to apparent stillness, the white stripes
being rendered plainly visible. The experiment is both
easy and interesting.</p>


<h3>§ 5. <i>Harmonic Sounds of Flame</i></h3>

<p>A singing flame yields so freely to the pulses falling
upon it that it is almost wholly governed by the sur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>rounding
tube; <em>almost</em>, but not altogether. The pitch of
the note depends in some measure upon the size of the
flame. This is readily proved, by causing two flames to
emit the same note, and then slightly altering the size of
either of them. The unison is instantly disturbed by
beats. By altering the size of a flame we can also, as
already illustrated, draw forth the harmonic overtones of
the tube which surrounds it. This experiment is best
performed with hydrogen, its combustion being much
more vigorous than that of ordinary gas. When a glass
tube 7 feet long is placed over a large hydrogen-flame,
the fundamental note of the tube is obtained, corresponding
to a division of the column of air within it by a
single node at the centre. Placing a second tube, 3 feet
6 inches long, over the same flame, no musical sound
whatever is obtained; the large flame, in fact, is not able
to accommodate itself to the vibrating period of the
shorter tube. But, on lessening the flame, it soon bursts
into vigorous song, its note being the octave of that
yielded by the longer tube. I now remove the shorter
tube, and once more cover the flame with the longer one.
It no longer sounds its fundamental notes, but the precise
note of the shorter tube. To accommodate itself to
the vibrating period of the diminished flame, the longer
column of air divides itself like an open organ-pipe when
it yields its first harmonic. By varying the size of the
flame, it is possible, with the tube now before you, to
obtain a series of notes whose rates of vibration are in
the ratio of the numbers 1:2:3:4:5; that is to say, the
fundamental tone and its first four harmonics.</p>

<p>These sounding flames, though probably never before
raised to the intensity in which they have been exhibited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
here to-day, are of old standing. In 1777, the sounds of
a hydrogen-flame were heard by Dr. Higgins. In 1802,
they were investigated to some extent by Chladni, who
also refers to an incorrect account of them given by De
Luc. Chladni showed that the tones are those of the
open tube which surrounds the flame, and he succeeded
in obtaining the first two harmonics. In 1802, G. De la
Rive experimented on this subject. Placing a little water
in the bulb of a thermometer, and heating it, he showed
that musical tones of force and sweetness could be produced
by the periodic condensation of the vapor in the
stem of the thermometer. He accordingly referred the
sounds of flames to the alternate expansion and condensation
of the aqueous vapor produced by the combustion.
We can readily imitate his experiments. Holding,
with its stem oblique, a thermometer-bulb containing
water in the flame of a spirit-lamp the sounds are heard
soon after the water begins to boil. In 1818, however,
Faraday showed that the tones are produced when the
tube surrounding the flame is placed in air of a temperature
higher than 100° C., condensation being then impossible.
He also showed that the tones could be obtained
from flames of carbonic oxide, where aqueous vapor is
entirely out of the question.</p>


<h3>§ 6. <i>Action of Extraneous Sounds on Flame: Experiments of
Schaffgotsch and Tyndall</i></h3>

<p>After these experiments, the first novel acoustic observation
on flames was made in Berlin by the late Count
Schaffgotsch, who showed that when an ordinary gas-flame
was surmounted by a short tube, a strong falsetto
voice pitched to the note of the tube, or to its higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
octave, caused the flame to quiver. In some cases when
the note of the tube was high, the flame could even be
extinguished by the voice.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1857, this experiment came to my
notice. No directions were given in the short account of
the observation published in “Poggendorff’s Annalen”;
but, in endeavoring to ascertain the conditions of success,
a number of singular effects forced themselves upon
my attention. Meanwhile, Count Schaffgotsch also followed
up the subject. To a great extent we travelled
over the same ground, neither of us knowing how the
other was engaged; but, so far as the experiments then
executed are common to us both, to Count Schaffgotsch
belongs the priority.</p>

<p>Let me here repeat his first observation. Within this
tube, 11 inches long, burns a small gas-flame, bright and
silent. The note of the tube has been ascertained, and
now, standing at some distance from the flame, I sound
that note; the flame <em>quivers</em>. To obtain the <em>extinction</em> of
the flame it is necessary to employ a burner with a very
narrow aperture, from which the gas issues under considerable
pressure. On gently sounding the note of the
tube surrounding such a flame, it quivers; but on throwing
more power into the voice the flame is extinguished.</p>

<p>The cause of the quivering of the flame will be best
revealed by an experiment with the siren. As the note
of the siren approaches that of the flame you hear beats,
and at the same time you observe a dancing of the flame
synchronous with the beats. The jumps succeed each
other more slowly as unison is approached. They cease
when the unison is perfect, and they begin again as soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
as the siren is urged beyond unison, becoming more
rapid as the discordance is increased. The cause of the
quiver observed by M. Schaffgotsch was revealed to me.
The flame jumped because the note of the tube surrounding
it was nearly, but not quite, in unison with the
voice of the experimenter.</p>

<p>That the jumping of the flame proceeds in exact accordance
with the beats is well shown by a tuning-fork,
which yields the same note as the flame. Loading such
a fork with a bit of wax, so as to throw it slightly out
of unison, and bringing it, when agitated, near the tube
in which the flame is singing, the beats and the leaps of
the flame occur at the same intervals. When the fork is
placed over a resonant jar, all of you can hear the beats,
and see at the same time the dancing of the flame. By
changing the load upon the tuning-fork, or by slightly
altering the size of the flame, the rate at which the beats
succeed each other may be altered; but in all cases the
jumps address the eye at the moments when the beats
address the ear.</p>

<p>While executing these experiments I noticed that, on
raising my voice to the proper pitch, a flame which had
been burning silently in its tube began to sing. The
same observation had, without my knowledge, been made
a short time previously by Count Schaffgotsch. A tube,
12 inches long, is placed over this flame, which occupies
a position about an inch and a half from the lower end
of the tube. When the proper note is sounded the flame
trembles, but it does not sing. When the tube is lowered
until the flame is three inches from its end, the song is
spontaneous. Between these two positions there is a
third, at which, if the flame be placed, it will burn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
silently; but if it be excited by the voice it will sing,
and continue to sing.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="f118" id="f118">
<img src="images/i_273.jpg" width="300" height="362" alt="Fig. 118." /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 118.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Even when the back is turned toward the flame the
sonorous pulses run round the body, reach the tube, and
call forth the song. A pitch-pipe, or any other instrument
which yields a note of the proper height, produces
the same effect. Mounting a series of tubes, capable of
emitting all the notes of the gamut, over suitable flames,
with an instrument sufficiently powerful, and from a distance
of 20 or 30 yards, a musician, by running over the
scale, might call forth all the notes in succession, the
whole series of flames finally joining in the song.</p>

<p>When a silent flame, capable of being excited in the
manner here described, is looked at in a moving mirror,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
it produces there a continuous band of light. Nothing
can be more beautiful than the sudden breaking up of
this band into a string of richly-luminous pearls at the
instant the voice is pitched to the proper note.</p>

<p>One singing flame may be caused to effect the musical
ignition of another. Before you are two small flames, <i>f′</i>
and <i>f</i>, Fig. 118 (p. 273), the tube over <i>f′</i> being 10-1/2 inches,
that over <i>f</i> 12 inches long. The shorter tube is clasped
by a paper slider, <i>s</i>. The flame <i>f′</i> is now singing, but the
flame <i>f</i>, in the longer tube, is silent. I raise the paper
slider which surrounds <i>f′</i>, so as to lengthen the tube, and
on approaching the pitch of the tube surrounding <i>f</i>, that
flame sings. The experiment may be varied by making
<i>f</i> the singing flame and <i>f′</i> the silent one at starting.
Raising the telescopic slider, a point is soon attained
where the flame <i>f′</i> commences its song. In this way one
flame may excite another through considerable distances.
It is also possible to silence the singing flame by the
proper management of the voice.</p>


<h3>SENSITIVE NAKED FLAMES</h3>

<h3>§ 7. <i>Discovery of Sensitive Flames by Le Conte</i></h3>

<p>We have hitherto dealt with flames surrounded by
resonant tubes; and none of these flames, if naked, would
respond in any way to such noise or music as could be
here applied. Still it is possible to make naked flames
thus sympathetic. This action of musical sounds upon
naked flames was first observed by Prof. Le Conte at a
musical party in the United States. His observation is
thus described: “Soon after the music commenced, I observed
that the flame exhibited pulsations which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
<em>exactly synchronous</em> with the audible beats. This phenomenon
was very striking to every one in the room, and
especially so when the strong notes of the violoncello
came in. It was exceedingly interesting to observe how
perfectly even the <em>trills</em> of this instrument were reflected
on the sheet of flame. <em>A deaf man might have seen the
harmony.</em> As the evening advanced, and the diminished
consumption of gas in the city <em>increased the pressure</em>, the
phenomenon became more conspicuous. The <em>jumping</em> of
the flame gradually increased, became somewhat irregular,
and, finally, it began to flare continuously, emitting the
characteristic sound, indicating the escape of a greater
amount of gas than could be properly consumed. I then
ascertained, by experiment, that the phenomenon <em>did not</em>
take place unless the discharge of gas was so regulated
that the flame approximated to the condition of <em>flaring</em>.
I likewise determined, by experiment, that the effects
<em>were not</em> produced by jarring or shaking the floor and
walls of the room by means of repeated concussions.
Hence it is obvious that the pulsations of the flame <em>were
not</em> owing to <em>indirect</em> vibrations propagated through the
medium of the walls of the room to the burning-apparatus,
but must have been produced by the <em>direct</em>
influence of aërial sonorous pulses on the burning jet.”<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<p>The significant remark, that the jumping of the flame
was not observed until it was near flaring, suggests the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>means of repeating the experiments of Dr. Le Conte;
while a more intimate knowledge of the conditions of
success enables us to vary and exalt them in a striking
degree. Before you burns a bright candle-flame, but no
sound that can be produced here has any effect upon it.
Though sonorous waves of great power be sent through
the air, the candle-flame remains insensible.</p>

<table summary="Figs. 119, 120."><tr>
<td><div class="figcenter">

</div></td></tr></table>

<p>But by proper precautions even a candle-flame may
be rendered sensitive. Urging from a small blow-pipe a
narrow stream of air through such a flame, an incipient
flutter is produced. The flame then jumps visibly to the
sound of a whistle, or to a chirrup. The experiment may
be so arranged that, when the whistle sounds, the flame
shall be either restored almost to its pristine brightness,
or that the small amount of light it still possesses shall
disappear.</p>

<p>The blow-pipe flame of our laboratory is totally unaffected
by the sound of the whistle as long as no air is
urged through it. By properly tempering the force of the
blast, a flame is obtained of the shape shown in Fig. 119.
On sounding the whistle the erect portion of the flame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
drops down, and while the sound continues the flame
maintains the form shown in Fig. 120.</p>


<h3>§ 8. <i>Experiments on Fish-tail and Bat’s-wing Flames</i></h3>

<p>We now pass on to a thin sheet of flame, issuing
from a common fish-tail burner, Fig. 121. You might
sing to this flame, varying the pitch of your voice; no
shiver of the flame would be visible. You might employ
pitch-pipes, tuning-forks, bells, and trumpets, with a like
absence of all effect. A barely perceptible motion of the
interior of the flame may be noticed when a shrill whistle
is blown close to it. But by turning the cock more fully
on, the flame is brought to the verge of flaring. And
now, when the whistle is blown, the flame thrusts suddenly
out seven quivering tongues, Fig. 122. The moment
the sound ceases, the tongues disappear, and the
flame becomes quiescent.</p>

<table summary="Figs. 121, 122."><tr>

<p>Passing from a fish-tail to a bat’s-wing burner, we
obtain a broad, steady flame, Fig. 123. It is quite insen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>sible
to the loudest sound which would be tolerable here.
The flame is fed from a small gas-holder.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> Increasing
gradually the pressure, a slight flutter of the edge of the
flame at length answers to the sound of the whistle.
Turning on the gas until the flame is on the point of
roaring, and blowing the whistle, it roars, and suddenly
assumes the form shown in Fig. 124.</p>

<p>When a distant anvil is struck with a hammer, the
flame instantly responds by thrusting forth its tongues.</p>

<table summary="Figs. 123, 124."><tr>

</div></td></tr></table>

<p>An essential condition to entire success in these experiments
disclosed itself in the following manner: I was
operating on two fish-tail flames, one of which jumped
to a whistle while the other did not. The gas of the
non-sensitive flame was turned off, additional pressure
being thereby thrown upon the other flame. It flared,
and its cock was turned so as to lower the flame; but
it now proved non-sensitive, however close it might be
brought to the point of flaring. The narrow orifice of
the half-turned cock interfered with the action of the
sound. When the gas was turned fully on, the flame
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>being lowered by opening the cock of the other burner,
it became again sensitive. Up to this time a great number
of burners had been tried, but with many of them
the action was <em>nil</em>. Acting, however, upon the hint conveyed
by this observation, the cocks which fed the
flames were more widely opened, and our most refractory
burners thus rendered sensitive.</p>

<p>In this way the observation of Dr. Le Conte is easily
and strikingly illustrated; in our subsequent, and far more
delicate, experiments the precaution just referred to is
still more essential.</p>


<h3>§ 9. <i>Experiments on Flames from Circular Apertures</i></h3>

<p>A long flame may be shortened and a short one
lengthened, according to circumstances, by sonorous vibrations.
The flame shown in Fig. 125 is long, straight,
and smoky; that in Fig. 126 is short, forked, and brilliant.
On sounding the whistle, the long flame becomes
short, forked, and brilliant, as in Fig. 127; while the
forked flame becomes long and smoky, as in Fig. 128.
As regards, therefore, their response to the sound of the
whistle, one of these flames is the complement of the
other.</p>

<p>In Fig. 129 is represented another smoky flame which,
when the whistle sounds, breaks up into the form shown
in Fig. 130.</p>

<p>When a brilliant sensitive flame illuminates an otherwise
dark room, in which a suitable bell is caused to
strike, a series of periodic quenchings of the light by the
sound occurs. Every stroke of the bell is accompanied

<p>The foregoing experiments illustrate the lengthening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
and shortening of flames by sonorous vibrations. They
may also produce <em>rotation</em>. From some of our homemade
burners issue flat flames, about ten inches high,
and three inches across at their widest part. When the
whistle sounds, the plane of each flame turns ninety
degrees round, and continues in its new position as long
as the sound continues.</p>

<p>A flame of admirable steadiness and brilliancy now
burns before you. It issues from a single circular orifice
in a common iron nipple. This burner, which requires
great pressure to make its flame flare, has been specially
chosen for the purpose of enabling you to observe, with
distinctness, the gradual change from apathy to sensitiveness.
The flame, now 4 inches high, is quite indifferent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
to sound. On increasing the pressure its height becomes
6 inches; but it is still indifferent. When its length is
12 inches, a barely perceptible quiver responds to the
whistle. When 16 or 17 inches high, it jumps briskly
the moment an anvil is tapped or the whistle sounded.
When the flame is 20 inches long you observe a quivering
at intervals, which announces that it is near roaring.
A slight increase of pressure causes it to roar, and
shorten at the same time to 8 inches.</p>

<p>Diminishing the pressure a little, the flame is again
20 inches long, but it is on the point of roaring and
shortening. Like the singing flames which were started
by the voice, it stands on the brink of a precipice. The
proper note pushes it over. It shortens when the whistle
sounds, exactly as it did when the pressure is in excess.
The action reminds one of the story of the Swiss muleteers,
who are said to tie up their bells at certain places
lest the tinkle should bring an avalanche down. The
snow must be very delicately poised before this could
occur. It probably never did occur, but our flame illustrates
the principle. We bring it to the verge of falling,
and the sonorous pulses precipitate what was already imminent.
This is the simple philosophy of all these
sensitive flames.</p>

<p>When the flame flares, the gas in the orifice of the
burner is in a state of vibration; conversely, when the
gas in the orifice is thrown into vibration, the flame, if
sufficiently near the flaring point, will flare. Thus the
sonorous vibrations, by acting on the gas in the passage
of the burner, become equivalent to an augmentation of
pressure in the holder. In fact, we have here revealed
to us the physical cause of flaring through excess of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
pressure, which, common as it is, has never been hitherto
explained. The gas encounters friction in the orifice of
the burner, which, when the force of transfer is sufficiently
great, throws the issuing stream into the state of
vibration that produces flaring. It is because the flaring
is thus caused that an infinitesimal amount of energy in
the form of vibrations of the proper period can produce
an effect equivalent to a considerable increase of pressure.</p>


<h3>§ 10. <i>Seat of Sensitiveness</i></h3>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 131.</span></div>
</div>

<p>That the external vibrations act upon the gas in the
orifice of the burner, and not first upon the burner itself,
the tube leading to it, or the flame above it, is thus
proved. A glass funnel <span class="smcap">R</span>, Fig. 131, is attached to a tube
3 feet long and half an inch in diameter. A sensitive
flame <i>b</i> is placed at the open end <span class="smcap">T</span> of the tube, while a
small high-pitched reed is placed in the funnel at <span class="smcap">R</span>.
When the sound is converged upon the root of the flame,
as in Fig. 131, the action is violent; when converged on
a point half an inch above the burner, as in Fig. 132, or
at half an inch below the burner, as in Fig. 133, there is
no action. The glass tube may be dispensed with and
the funnel alone employed, if care be taken to screen off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
all sound, save that which passes through the shank of
the funnel.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<p>All sounds are not equally effective on the flame;
waves of special periods are required to produce the
maximum effect. The effectual periods are those which
synchronize with the waves produced by the friction of
the gas itself against the sides of its orifice. With some
of these flames a low deep whistle is more effective than
a shrill one. With others the exciting tremors must be
very rapid, and the sound consequently shrill. Not one
of these four tuning-forks, which vibrate 256 times, 320
times, 384 times, and 512 times respectively in a second,
has any effect upon the flame from our iron nipple. But,
besides their fundamental tones, these forks, as you know,
can be caused to yield a series of overtones of very high
pitch. The vibrations of this series are 1,600, 2,000,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>2,400, and 3,200 per second, respectively. The flame
jumps in response to each of these sounds; the response
to that of the highest pitch being the most prompt and
energetic of all.</p>

<p>To the tap of a hammer upon a board the flame responds;
but to the tap of the same hammer upon an anvil
the response is much more brisk and animated. The
reason is, that the clang of the anvil is
rich in the higher tones to which the
flame is most sensitive. The powerful tone
obtained when our inverted bell is reinforced
by its resonant tube has no power
over this flame. But when a halfpenny is
brought into contact with the vibrating surface
the flame instantly shortens, flutters,
and roars. I send an assistant with a
smaller bell, worked by clockwork, to the
most distant part of the gallery. He there
detaches the hammer; the strokes follow
each other in rhythmic succession, and at
every stroke the flame falls from a height
of 20 to a height of 8 inches, roaring as
it falls.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;134.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fig.&nbsp;135.</span></div>
</div>



<p>The rapidity with which sound is propagated
through air is well illustrated by
these experiments. There is no sensible
interval between the stroke of the bell and the ducking
of the flame.</p>

<p>When the sound acting on the flame is of very short
duration a curious and instructive effect is observed.
The sides of the flame half-way down, and lower, are
seen suddenly fringed by luminous tongues, the central<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
flame remaining apparently undisturbed in both height
and thickness. The flame in its normal state is shown in
Fig. 134, and with its fringes in Fig. 135. The effect is
due to the retention of the impression upon the retina.
The flame actually falls as low as the fringes, but its recovery
is so quick that to the eye it does not appear to
shorten at all.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>


<h3>§ 12. <i>The Vowel-flame</i></h3>

<p>A flame of astonishing sensitiveness now burns before
you. It issues from the single orifice of a steatite burner,
and reaches a height of 24 inches. The slightest tap on
a distant anvil reduces its height to 7 inches. When a
bunch of keys is shaken the flame is violently agitated,
and emits a loud roar. The dropping of a sixpence into
a hand already containing coin, at a distance of 20 yards,
knocks the flame down. It is not possible to walk across
the floor without agitating the flame. The creaking of
boots sets it in violent commotion. The crumpling, or
tearing of paper, or the rustle of a silk dress, does the
same. It is startled by the patter of a rain-drop. I hold
a watch near the flame: nobody hears its ticks; but you
all see their effect upon the flame. At every tick it falls
and roars. The winding up of the watch also produces
tumult. The twitter of a distant sparrow shakes the
flame; the note of a cricket would do the same. A
chirrup from a distance of 30 yards causes it to fall and
roar. I repeat a passage from Spenser:</p>

</div>

<p>The flame selects from the sounds those to which it
can respond. It notices some by the slightest nod,
to others it bows more distinctly, to some its
obeisance is very profound, while to many sounds
it turns an entirely deaf ear.</p>



<p>In Fig. 136, this wonderful flame is represented.
On chirruping to it, or on shaking a bunch of
keys within a few yards of it, it falls to the size
shown in Fig. 137, the whole length, <i>a b</i>, of the
flame being suddenly abolished. The light at the
same time is practically destroyed, a pale and
almost non-luminous residue of it alone remaining.
These figures are taken from photographs
of the flame.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_286b.jpg" width="75" height="307" alt="Fig. 137." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 137.</span></div>
</div>

<p>To distinguish it from the others I have
called this the “vowel-flame,” because the
different vowel-sounds affect it differently.
A loud and sonorous <span class="smcap">U</span> does not move the
flame; on changing the sound to <span class="smcap">O</span>, the
flame quivers; when <span class="smcap">E</span> is sounded, the flame
is strongly affected. I utter the words <em>boot</em>,
<em>boat</em>, and <em>beat</em>, in succession. To the first
there is no response; to the second, the
flame starts; by the third, is thrown into greater
commotion; the sound <em>Ah!</em> is still more powerful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
Did we not know the constitution of vowel-sounds this
deportment would be an insoluble enigma. As it is,
however, the flame illustrates the theory of vowel-sounds.
It is most sensitive to sounds of high pitch; hence we
should infer that the sound <em>Ah!</em> contains higher notes
than the sound <span class="smcap">E</span>; that <span class="smcap">E</span> contains higher notes than <span class="smcap">O</span>;
and <span class="smcap">O</span> higher notes than <span class="smcap">U</span>. I need not say that this
agrees perfectly with the analysis of Helmholtz.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_287.jpg" width="150" height="296" alt="Fig. 138." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 138.</span></div>
</div>

<p>This flame is peculiarly sensitive to the utterance of
the letter <span class="smcap">S</span>. A hiss contains the elements
that most forcibly affect the
flame. The gas issues from its burner
with a hiss, and an external sound of
this character is therefore exceedingly
effective. From a metal box containing
compressed air I allow a puff to
escape; the flame instantly ducks down
not by any transfer of <em>air</em> from the
box to the flame, for the distance between
both utterly excludes this idea—it
is the <em>sound</em> that affects the flame.
From the most distant part of the
gallery my assistant permits the compressed
air to issue in puffs from the box; at every puff
the flame suddenly falls. The hiss of the issuing air
at the one orifice precipitates the tumult of the flame at
the other.</p>

<p>When a musical-box is placed on the table, and permitted
to play, the flame behaves like a sentient and
motor creature—bowing slightly to some tones, and courtesying
deeply to others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span></p>

<h3>§ 13. <i>Mr. Philip Harry’s Sensitive Flame</i></h3>

<p>Mr. Philip Barry has discovered a new and very effective
form of sensitive flame, which he thus describes in
a letter to myself: “It is the most sensitive of all the
flames that I am acquainted with, though from its smaller
size it is not so striking as your vowel-flame. It possesses
the advantage that the ordinary pressure in the
gas-mains is quite sufficient to produce it. The method
of producing it consists in igniting the gas (ordinary
coal-gas) not at the burner but some inches above it, by
interposing between the burner and the flame a piece of
wire-gauze.”</p>

<p>I give a sketch of the arrangement adopted in Fig. 138.
The space between the burner and gauze was 2 inches.
The gauze was about 7 inches square, resting on the ring
of a retort-stand. It had 32 meshes to the lineal inch.
The burner was Sugg’s steatite pinhole burner, the same
as used for the vowel-flame.</p>

<p>The flame is a slender cone about four inches high,
the upper portion giving a bright-yellow light, the base
being a non-luminous blue flame. At the least noise
this flame roars, sinking down to the surface of the
gauze, becoming at the same time invisible. It is
very active in its responses, and, being rather a noisy
flame, its sympathy is apparent to the ear as well as
the eye.</p>

<p>“To the vowel-sounds it does not appear to answer
so discriminately as the vowel-flame. It is extremely
sensitive to <span class="smcap">A</span>, very slightly to <span class="smcap">E</span>, more so to <span class="smcap">I</span>, entirely
non-sensitive to <span class="smcap">O</span>, but slightly sensitive to <span class="smcap">U</span>.</p>

<p>“It dances in the most perfect manner to a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
musical snuff-box, and is highly sensitive to most of
the sonorous vibrations which affect the vowel-flames.”</p>


<h3>§ 14. <i>Sensitive Smoke-jets</i></h3>

<p>It is not to the flame, as such, that we owe the extraordinary
phenomena which have been just described.
Effects substantially the same are obtained when a jet
of unignited gas, of carbonic acid, hydrogen, or even
air itself, issues from an orifice under proper pressure.
None of these gases, however, can be seen in its passage
through air, and, therefore, we must associate with
them some substance which, while sharing their motions,
will reveal them to the eye. The method employed from
time to time in this place of rendering aërial vortices
visible is well known to many of you. By tapping a
membrane which closes the mouth of a large funnel filled
with smoke, we obtain beautiful smoke-rings, which reveal
the motion of the air. By associating smoke with
our gas-jets, in the present instance, we can also trace
their course, and, when this is done, the unignited gas
proves as sensitive as the flames. The smoke-jets jump,
shorten, split into forks, or lengthen into columns, when
the proper notes are sounded.</p>

<p>Underneath this gas-holder are placed two small
basins, the one containing hydrochloric acid, and the
other ammonia. Fumes of sal-ammoniac are thus copiously
formed, and mingle with the gas contained in the
holder. We may, as already stated, operate with coal-gas,
carbonic acid, air, or hydrogen; each of them yields
good effects. From our excellent steatite burner now
issues a thin column of smoke. On sounding the whistle,
which was so effective with the flames, it is found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
ineffective. When, moreover, the highest notes of a
series of Pandean pipes are sounded, they are also
ineffective. Nor will the lowest notes answer. But
when a certain pipe, which stands about the middle
of the series, is sounded, the smoke-column falls, forming
a short stem with a thick, bushy head. It is also
pressed down, as if by a vertical wind, by a knock upon
the table. At every tap it drops. A stroke on an anvil,
on the contrary, produces little or no effect. In fact, the
notes here effective are of a
much lower pitch than those
which were most efficient in
the case of the flames.</p>

<div class="figleft250">
<img src="images/i_290.jpg" width="250" height="317" alt="Fig. 139." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 139.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The amount of shrinkage
exhibited by some of these
smoke-columns, in proportion
to their length, is far
greater than that of the
flames. A tap on the table
causes a smoke-jet eighteen
inches high to shorten to
a bushy bouquet, with a
stem not more than an inch
in height. The smoke-column, moreover, responds to the
voice. A cough knocks it down; and it dances to the
tune of a musical-box. Some notes cause the mere top
of the smoke-column to gather itself up into a bunch;
at other notes the bunch is formed midway down; while
notes of more suitable pitch cause the column to contract
itself to a cumulus not much more than an inch above
the end of the burner. Various forms of the dancing
smoke-jet are shown in Fig. 139. As the music con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>tinues,
the action of the smoke-column consists of a
series of rapid leaps from one of these forms to another.</p>

<p>In a perfectly still atmosphere these slender smoke-columns
rise sometimes to a height of nearly two feet,
apparently vanishing into air at the summit. When this
is the case, our most sensitive flames fall far behind them
in delicacy; and though less striking than the flames, the
smoke-wreaths are often more graceful. Not only special
words, but every word, and even every syllable, of the
foregoing stanza from Spenser, tumbles a really sensitive
smoke-jet into confusion. To produce such effects, a
perfectly tranquil atmosphere is necessary. Flame-experiments,
in fact, are possible in an atmosphere where
smoke-jets are utterly unmanageable.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></p>


<h3>§ 15. <i>Constitution of Liquid Veins: Sensitive Water-jets</i></h3>

<div class="figleft200"><a name="f140" id="f140">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 140.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fig. 141.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fig. 142.</span></div>
</div>


<p>We have thus far confined our attention to jets of
ignited and unignited coal-gas—of carbonic acid, hydrogen,
and air. We will now turn to jets of water. And
here a series of experiments, remarkable for their beauty,
has long existed, which claim relationship to those just
described. These are the experiments of Felix Savart on
liquid veins. If the bottom of a vessel containing water
be pierced by a circular orifice, the descending liquid
vein will exhibit two parts unmistakably distinct. The
part of the vein nearest the orifice is steady and limpid,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>presenting the appearance of a
solid glass rod. It decreases in
diameter as it descends, reaches
a point of maximum contraction,
from which point downward
it appears turbid and unsteady.
The course of the vein,
moreover, is marked by periodic
swellings and contractions. Savart
has represented these appearances
as in Fig. 140. The
part <i>a n</i> nearest the orifice is
limpid and steady, while all the
part below <i>n</i> is in a state of quivering
motion. This lower part
of the vein appears continuous
to the eye; but the finger can
be sometimes passed through it
without being wetted. This, of
course, could not be the case if
the vein were really continuous.
The upper portion of the vein,
moreover, intercepts vision; the
lower portion, even when the
liquid is mercury, does not. In
fact, the vein resolves itself, at
<i>n</i>, into liquid spherules, its apparent
continuity being due to
the retention of the impressions
made by the falling drops upon
the retina. If, while looking at
the disturbed portion of the vein,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
the head be suddenly lowered, the descending column
will be resolved for a moment into separate drops. Perhaps
the simplest way of reducing the vein to its constituent
spherules is to illuminate the vein, in a dark
room, by a succession of electric flashes. Every flash
reveals the drops, as if they were perfectly motionless
in the air.</p>

<p>Could the appearance of the vein illuminated by a
single flash be rendered permanent, it would be that
represented in Fig. 141. And here we find revealed
the cause of those swellings and contractions which the
disturbed portion of the vein exhibits. The drops, as
they descend, are continually changing their forms.
When first detached from the end of the limpid portion
of the vein, the drop is a spheroid with its longest
axis vertical. But a liquid cannot retain this shape,
if abandoned to the forces of its own molecules. The
spheroid seeks to become a sphere—the longer diameter,
therefore, shortens; but, like a pendulum which seeks to
return to its position of rest, the contraction of the vertical
diameter goes too far, and the drop becomes a flattened
spheroid. Now, the contractions of the jet are
formed at those places where the longest axis of the
drop is vertical, while the swellings appear where the
longest axis is horizontal. It will be noticed that between
every two of the larger drops is a third one of
much smaller dimensions. According to Savart, their
appearance is invariable.</p>

<p>I wish to make the constitution of a liquid vein evident
to you by a simple but beautiful experiment. The
condensing lens has been removed from our electric lamp,
the light being permitted to pass through a vertical slit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
directly from the carbon-points. The slice of light thus
obtained is so divergent that it illuminates, from top to
bottom, a liquid vein several feet long, and placed at
some distance from the lamp. Immediately in front of
the camera is a large disk of zinc with six radial slits,
about ten inches long and an inch wide. By the rotation
of the disk the light is caused to fall in flashes upon the
jet; and, when the suitable speed of rotation has been attained,
the vein is resolved into its constituent spherules.
Receiving the shadow of the vein upon a white screen,
its constitution is rendered clearly visible to all here
present.</p>

<p>This breaking-up of a liquid vein into drops has been
a subject of frequent experiment and much discussion.
Savart traced the pulsations to the orifice, but he did
not think that they were produced by friction. They
are powerfully influenced by sonorous vibrations. In the
midst of a large city it is hardly possible to obtain the
requisite tranquillity for the full development of the continuous,
portion of the vein; still, Savart was so far able
to withdraw his vein from the influence of such irregular
vibrations that its limpid portion became elongated to
the extent shown in <a href="#f140">Fig. 142</a>. It will be understood
that <a href="#f140">Fig. 141</a> represents a vein exposed to the irregular
vibrations of the city of Paris, while <a href="#f140">Fig. 142</a> represents
one produced under precisely the same conditions, but
withdrawn from those vibrations.</p>

<p>The drops into which the vein finally resolves itself
are incipient even in its limpid portion, announcing themselves
there as annular protuberances, which become more
and more pronounced, until finally they separate. Their
birthplace is near the orifice itself, and under even mod<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>erate
pressure they succeed each other with sufficient rapidity
to produce a feeble musical note. By permitting
the drops to fall upon a membrane, the pitch of this
note may be fixed; and now we come to the point which
connects the phenomena of liquid veins with those of
sensitive flames and smoke-jets. If a note in unison with
that of the vein be sounded near it, the limpid portion
instantly shortens; the pitch may vary to some extent,
and still cause a shortening; but the unisonant note is
the most effectual. Savart’s experiments on vertically-descending
veins have been recently repeated in our laboratory
with striking effect. From a distance of thirty
yards the limpid portion of the vein has been shortened
by the sound of an organ-pipe of the proper pitch and
of moderate intensity.</p>

<p>I have also recently gone carefully, not merely by
reading, but by experiment, over Plateau’s account of
the resolution of a liquid vein into drops. In his researches
on the figures of equilibrium of bodies withdrawn
from the action of gravity, he finds that a liquid
cylinder is stable as long as its length does not exceed
three times its diameter; or, more accurately, as long as
the ratio between them does not exceed that of the diameter
of a circle to its circumference, or 3.1416. If this be
a little exceeded the cylinder begins to narrow at some
point or other of its length; nips itself together, breaks,
and forms immediately two spheres. If the ratio of the
length of the cylinder to its diameter greatly exceed
3.1416, then, instead of breaking up into two spheres, it
breaks up into several.</p>

<p>A liquid cylinder may be obtained by introducing
olive-oil into a mixture of alcohol and water, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
same density as the oil. The latter forms a sphere.
Two disks of smaller diameter than the sphere are
brought into contact with it, and then drawn apart;
the oil clings to the disks, and the sphere is transformed
into a cylinder. If the quantity of oil be insufficient
to produce the maximum length of cylinder,
more may be added by a pipette. In making this experiment
it will be noticed that, when the proper length
is exceeded, the nipped portion of the cylinder elongates,
and exists for a moment as a very thin liquid cylinder
uniting the two incipient spheres; and that, when rupture
occurs, the thin cylinder, which has also exceeded
<em>its</em> proper length, breaks so as to form a small spherule
between the two larger ones. This is a point of considerable
significance in relation to our present question.</p>

<p>Now, Plateau contends that the play of the molecular
forces in a liquid cylinder is not suspended by its
motion of translation. The first portion of a vein of
water quitting an orifice is a cylinder, to which the laws
which he has established regarding motionless cylinders
apply. The moment the descending vein exceeds the
proper length it begins to pinch itself so as to form
drops; but urged forward as it is by the pressure above
it, and by its own gravity, in the time required for the
rounding of the drop it reaches a certain distance from
the orifice. At this distance, the pressure remaining constant,
and the vein being withdrawn from external disturbance,
rupture invariably occurs. And the rupture is
accompanied by the phenomenon which has just been
called significant. Between every two succeeding large
drops a small spherule is formed, as shown in <a href="#f140">Fig. 141</a>.</p>

<p>Permitting a vein of oil to fall from an orifice, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
through the air, but through a mixture of alcohol and
water of the proper density, the continuous portion of
the vein, its resolution into drops, and the formation
of the small spherule between each liberated drop and
the end of the liquid cylinder which it has just quitted,
may be watched with the utmost deliberation. The effect
of this and other experiments upon the mind will be to
produce the conviction that the very beautiful explanation
offered by Plateau is also the true one. The various
laws established experimentally by Savart all follow
immediately from Plateau’s theory.</p>

<p>In a small paper published more than twenty years
ago I drew attention to the fact that when a descending
vein intersects a liquid surface above the point of rupture,
if the pressure be not too great, it enters the liquid
<em>silently</em>; but when the surface intersects the vein below
the point of rupture a rattle is immediately heard, and
bubbles are copiously produced. In the former case, not
only is there no violent dashing aside of the liquid, but
round the base of the vein, and in opposition to its motion,
the liquid collects in a heap, by its surface tension
or capillary attraction. This experiment can be combined
with two other observations of Savart’s, in a beautiful
and instructive manner. In addition to the shortening
of the continuous portion by sound, Savart found that,
when he permitted his membrane to intersect the vein
at one of its protuberances, the sound was louder than
when the intersection occurred at the contracted portion.</p>

<p>I permitted a vein to descend, under scarcely any
pressure, from a tube three-quarters of an inch in diameter,
and to enter silently a basin of water placed nearly
20 inches below the orifice. On sounding vigorously a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
Ut<sub>2</sub> tuning-fork the pellucid jet was instantly broken, and
as many as three of its swellings were seen above the
surface. The rattle of air-bubbles was instantly heard,
and the basin was seen to be filled with them. The
sound was allowed slowly to die out; the continuous
portion of the vein lengthened, and a series of alternations
in the production of the bubbles was observed.
When the swellings of the vein cut the surface of the
water, the bubbles were copious and loud; when the contracted
portions crossed the surface, the bubbles were
scanty and scarcely audible.</p>

<p>Removing the basin, placing an iron tray in its place,
and exciting the fork, the vein, which at first struck
silently upon the tray, commenced a rattle which rose
and sank with the dying out of the sound, according
as the swellings or contractions of the jet impinged upon
the surface. This is a simple and beautiful experiment.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="f143" id="f143">
<img src="images/i_299abc.jpg" width="400" height="426" alt="Figs. 143, 144, 145." /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">From top: Figs. 143, 144, 145.</span></div>
</div>


<p>Savart also caused his vein to issue horizontally and
at various inclinations to the horizon, and found that, in
certain cases, sonorous vibrations were competent to cause
a jet to divide into two or three branches. In these experiments
the liquid was permitted to issue through an
orifice in a thin plate. Instead of this, however, we will
resort to our favorite steatite burner; for with water also
it asserts the same mastery over its fellows that it exhibited
with flames and smoke-jets. It will, moreover,
reveal to us some entirely novel results. By means of an
India-rubber tube the burner is connected with the water-pipes
of the Institution, and, by pointing it obliquely
upward, we obtain a fine parabolic jet (<a href="#f143">Fig. 143</a>). At
a certain distance from the orifice, the vein resolves itself
into beautiful spherules, whose motions are not rapid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
enough to make the vein appear continuous. At the
vertex of the parabola the spray of pearls is more than
an inch in width, and, further on, the drops are still
more widely scattered. On sweeping a fiddle-bow across
a tuning-fork which executes 512 vibrations in a second,
the scattered drops, as if drawn together by their mutual
attractions, instantly close up, and form an apparently
continuous liquid arch several feet in height and span
(shown in <a href="#f143">Fig. 144</a>). As long as the proper note is
maintained the vein looks like a frozen band, so motionless
does it appear. On stopping the fork the arch
is shaken asunder, and we have the same play of liquid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
pearls as before. Every sweep of the bow, however,
causes the drops to fall into a common line of march.</p>

<p>A pitch-pipe, or an organ-pipe yielding the note of
this tuning-fork, also powerfully controls the vein. The
voice does the same. On pitching it to a note of moderate
intensity, it causes the wandering drops to gather
themselves together. At a distance of twenty yards, the
voice is, to all appearance, as powerful in curbing the
vein, and causing its drops to close up, as it is when
close to the issuing jet.</p>

<p>The effect of “beats” upon the vein is also beautiful
and instructive. They may be produced either by organ-pipes
or by tuning-forks. When two forks vibrate, the
one 512 times and the other 508 times in a second, you
will learn in our next lecture that they produce four beats
in a second. When the forks are sounded the beats are
heard, and the liquid vein is seen to gather up its pearls,
and scatter them in synchronism with the beats. The
sensitiveness of this vein is astounding; it rivals that of
the ear itself. Placing the two tuning-forks on a distant
table, and permitting the beats to die gradually out, the
vein continues its rhythm almost as long as hearing is
possible. A more sensitive vein might actually prove superior
to the ear—a very surprising result, considering
the marvellous delicacy of this organ.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></p>

<p>By introducing a Leyden-jar into the circuit of a powerful
induction-coil, a series of dense and dazzling flashes
of light, each of momentary duration, is obtained. Every
such flash in a darkened room renders the drops distinct,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>each drop being transformed into a little star of intense
brilliancy. If the vein be then acted on by a sound of
the proper pitch, it instantly gathers its drops together
into a necklace of inimitable beauty.</p>

<p>In these experiments the whole vein gathers itself into
a single arched band when the proper note is sounded;
but, by varying the conditions, it may be caused to divide
into two or more such bands, as shown in <a href="#f143">Fig. 145</a>.
Drawings, however, are ineffectual here; for the wonder
of these experiments depends mainly on the sudden transition
of the vein from one state to the other. In the
<em>motion</em> dwells the surprise, and this no drawing can
render.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>


<h3>SUMMARY OF CHAPTER VI</h3>

<p>When a gas-flame is placed in a tube, the air in passing
over the flame is thrown into vibration, musical
sounds being the consequence.</p>

<p>Making allowance for the high temperature of the column
of air associated with the flame, the pitch of the
note is that of an open organ-pipe of the length of
the tube surrounding the flame.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span></p>
<p>The vibrations of the flame, while the sound continues,
consist of a series of periodic extinctions, total
or partial, between every two of which the flame partially
recovers its brightness.</p>

<p>The periodicity of the phenomenon may be demonstrated
by means of a concave mirror which forms an
image of the vibrating flame upon a screen. When the
image is sharply defined, the rotation of the mirror reduces
the single image to a series of separate images of
the flame. The dark spaces between the images correspond
to the extinctions of the flame, while the images
themselves correspond to its periods of recovery.</p>

<p>Besides the fundamental note of the associated tube,
the flame can also be caused to excite the higher overtones
of the tube. The successive divisions of the column
of air are those of an open organ-pipe when its
harmonic tones are sounded.</p>

<p>On sounding a note nearly in unison with a tube containing
a silent flame, the flame jumps; and if the position
of the flame in the tube be rightly chosen, the extraneous
sound will cause the flame to sing.</p>

<p>While the flame is singing, a note nearly in unison
with its own produces beats, and the flame is seen to jump
in synchronism with the beats. The jumping is also observed
when the position of the flame within its tube is
not such as to enable it to sing.</p>


<h3>NAKED FLAMES</h3>

<p>When the pressure of the gas which feeds a naked
flame is augmented, the flame, up to a certain point, increases
in size. But if the pressure be too great, the
flame roars or flares.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span></p>

<p>The roaring or flaring of the flame is caused by the
state of vibration into which the gas is thrown in the
orifice of the burner, when the pressure which urges it
through the orifice is excessive.</p>

<p>If the vibrations in the orifice of the burner be super-induced
by an extraneous sound, the flame will flare
under a pressure less than that which, of itself, would
produce flaring.</p>

<p>The gas under excessive pressure has vibrations of
a definite period impressed upon it as it passes through
the burner. To operate with a maximum effect upon the
flame the external sound must contain vibrations synchronous
with those of the issuing gas.</p>

<p>When such a sound is chosen, and when the flame is
brought sufficiently near its flaring-point, it furnishes an
acoustic reagent of unexampled delicacy.</p>

<p>At a distance of 30 yards, for example, the chirrup of
a house-sparrow would be competent to throw the flame
into commotion.</p>

<p>It is not to the flame, as such, that we are to ascribe
these effects. Effects substantially similar are produced
when we employ jets of unignited coal-gas, carbonic acid,
hydrogen, or air. These jets may be rendered visible by
smoke, and the smoke jets show a sensitiveness to sonorous
vibrations even greater than that of the flames.</p>

<p>When a brilliant sensitive flame illuminates an otherwise
dark room, in which a suitable bell is caused to
strike, a series of periodic quenchings of the light by the
sound occurs. Every stroke of the bell is accompanied
by a momentary darkening of the room.</p>

<p>A jet of water descending from a circular orifice is
composed of two distinct portions, the one pellucid and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
calm; the other in commotion. When properly analyzed
the former portion is found continuous; the latter being
a succession of drops.</p>

<p>If these drops be received upon a membrane, a musical
sound is produced. When an extraneous sound of
this particular pitch is produced in the neighborhood of
the vein, the continuous portion is seen to shorten.</p>

<p>The continuous portion of the vein presents a series
of swellings and contractions, in the former of which the
drops are flattened, and in the latter elongated. The
sound produced by the flattened drops on striking the
membrane is louder than that produced by the elongated
ones.</p>

<p>Above its point of rupture a vein of water may be
caused to enter water <em>silently</em>; but on sounding a suitable
note, the rattle of bubbles is immediately heard; the discontinuous
part of the vein rises above the surface, and
as the sound dies out the successive swellings and contractions
produce alternations of the quantity and sound
of the bubbles.</p>

<p>In veins propelled obliquely, the scattered water-drops
may be called together by a suitable sound, so as to form
an apparently continuous liquid arch.</p>

<p>Liquid veins may be analyzed by the electric spark,
or by a succession of flashes illuminating the veins.</p>

ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO THE QUESTION

<h4>§ 1. <i>Introduction</i></h4>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>E ARE now fully equipped for the investigation
of an important practical problem. The cloud
produced by the puff of a locomotive can quench
the rays of the noonday sun; it is not, therefore, surprising
that in dense fogs our most powerful coast-lights,
including even the electric light, should become useless
to the mariner.</p>

<p>Disastrous shipwrecks are the consequence. During
the last ten years no less than two hundred and seventy-three
vessels have been reported as totally lost on our
own coasts in fog or thick weather. The loss, I believe,
has been far greater on the American seaboard, where
trade is more eager, and fogs more frequent, than they
are here. No wonder, then, that earnest efforts should
be made to find a substitute for light in sound-signals,
powerful enough to give warning and guidance to mariners
while still at a safe distance from the shore.</p>

<p>Such signals have been established to some extent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
upon our own coasts, and to a still greater extent along
the coasts of Canada and the United States. But the
evidence as to their value and performance is of the
most conflicting character, and no investigation sufficiently
thorough to clear up the uncertainty has hitherto
been made. In fact, while the <em>velocity</em> of sound has
formed the subject of refined and repeated experiment
by the ablest philosophers, the publication of Dr. Derham’s
celebrated paper in the “Philosophical Transactions”
for 1708 marks the latest systematic inquiry into
the causes which affect the <em>intensity</em> of sound in the
atmosphere.</p>

<p>Jointly with the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House,
and as their scientific adviser, I have recently had the
honor of conducting an inquiry designed to fill the blank
here indicated.</p>

<p>One or two brief references will suffice to show the
state of the question when this investigation began.
“Derham,” says Sir John Herschel, “found that fogs
and falling rain, but more especially snow, tend powerfully
to obstruct the propagation of sound, and that the
same effect was produced by a coating of fresh-fallen snow
on the ground, though when glazed and hardened at the
surface by freezing it had no such influence.”<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></p>

<p>In a very clear and able letter, addressed to the President
of the Board of Trade in 1863,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> Dr. Robinson, of
Armagh, thus summarizes our knowledge of fog-signals:
“Nearly all that is known about fog-signals is to be
found in the ‘Report on Lights and Beacons’; and of it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>much is little better than conjecture. Its substance is
as follows:</p>

<p>“‘Light is scarcely available for this purpose. Blue
lights are used in the Hooghly; but it is not stated at
what distance they are visible in fog; their glare may
be seen further than their flame.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> It might, however, be
desirable to ascertain how far the electric light, or its
flash, can be traced.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<p>“‘Sound is the only known means really effective; but
about it testimonies are conflicting, and there is scarcely
one fact relating to its use as a signal which can be considered
as established. Even the most important of all,
the distance at which it ceases to be heard, is undecided.</p>

<p>“‘Up to the present time all signal-sounds have been
made in air, though this medium has grave disadvantages:
its own currents interfere with the sound-waves, so that a
gun or bell which is heard several miles <em>down</em> the wind
is inaudible more than a few furlongs <em>up</em> it. A still
greater evil is that it is least effective when most needed;
for fog is a powerful damper of sound.’”</p>

<p>Dr. Robinson here expresses the universally-prevalent
opinion, and he then assigns the theoretic cause. “Fog,”
he says, “is a mixture of air and globules of water, and
at each of the innumerable surfaces where these two
touch, a portion of the vibration is reflected and lost.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>
... Snow produces a similar effect, and one still more
injurious.”</p>

<p>Reflection being thus considered to take place at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>surfaces of the suspended particles, it followed that the
greater the number of particles, or, in other words, the
denser the fog, the more injurious would be its action
upon sound. Hence optic transparency came to be considered
a measure of acoustic transparency. On this
point Dr. Robinson, in the letter referred to, expresses
himself thus: “At the outset, it is obvious that, to make
experiments <em>comparable</em>, we must have some measure of
the fog’s power of stopping sound, without attending to
which the most anomalous results may be expected. It
seems probable that this will bear some simple relation
to its opacity to light, and that the distance at which a
given object, as a flag or pole, disappears may be taken
as the measure.” “Still, clear air” was regarded in this
letter as the best vehicle of sound, the alleged action of
fogs, rain, and snow being ascribed to their rendering
the atmosphere “a discontinuous medium.”</p>

<p>Prior to the investigation now to be described, the
views here enunciated were those universally entertained.
That sound is unable to penetrate fogs was taken to be
“a matter of common observation.” The bells and horns
of ships were affirmed “not to be heard so far in fogs as
in clear weather.” In the fogs of London the noise of
the carriage-wheels was reported to be so much diminished
that “they seem to be at a distance where really
close by.” My knowledge does not inform me of the
existence of any other source for these opinions regarding
the deadening power of fog than the paper of Derham,
published one hundred and sixty-seven years ago. In
consequence of their <em>à priori</em> probability, his conclusions
seem to have been transmitted unquestioned from generation
to generation of scientific men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span></p>

<h4>§ 2. <i>Instruments and Observations</i></h4>

<p>On the 19th of May, 1873, this inquiry began. The
South Foreland, near Dover, was chosen as the signal-station,
steam-power having been already established there
to work two powerful magneto-electro lights. The observations
for the most part were made afloat, one of the
yachts of the Trinity Corporation being usually employed
for this purpose. Two stations had been established, the
one at the top, the other at the bottom, of the South
Foreland Cliff; and at each of them trumpets, air-whistles,
and steam-whistles of great size were mounted.
The whistles first employed were of English manufacture.
To these was afterward added a large United States
whistle, and also a Canadian whistle, of great reputed
power.</p>

<p>On the 8th of October another instrument, which has
played a specially important part in these observations,
was introduced. This was a steam-siren, constructed and
patented by Mr. Brown of New York, and introduced by
Prof. Henry into the lighthouse system of the United
States. As an example of international courtesy worthy
of imitation, I refer with pleasure to the fact that when
informed by Major Elliot of the United States Army that
our experiments had begun, the Lighthouse Board at
Washington, of their own spontaneous kindness, forwarded
to us for trial a very noble instrument of this description,
which was immediately mounted at the South Foreland.</p>

<p>In the steam-siren, as in the ordinary one, described
in Chapter II., a fixed disk and a rotating disk are employed,
but radial slits are used instead of circular apertures.
One disk is fixed vertically across the throat of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
conical trumpet 16-1/2 feet long, 5 inches in diameter where
the disk crosses it, and gradually opening out till at the
other extremity it reaches a diameter of 2 feet 3 inches.
Behind the fixed disk is the rotating one, which is driven
by separate mechanism. The trumpet is connected with a
boiler. In our experiments steam of 70 lbs. pressure was
for the most part employed. Just as in the ordinary
siren, when the radial slits of the two disks coincide, and
then only, a strong puff of steam escapes. Sound-waves
of great intensity are thus sent through the air, the pitch
of the note depending on the velocity of rotation. (A
drawing of the steam-siren constitutes our frontispiece.)</p>

<p>To the siren, trumpets, and whistles were added three
guns—an 18-pounder, a 5-1/2-inch howitzer, and a 13-inch
mortar. In our summer experiments all three were fired;
but the howitzer having shown itself superior to the
other guns it was chosen in our autumn experiments as
not only a fair but a favorable representative of this form
of signal. The charges fired were for the most part those
now employed at Holyhead, Lundy Island, and the Kish
light-vessel; namely, 3 lbs. of powder. Gongs and bells
were not included in this inquiry, because previous observations
had clearly proved their inferiority to the trumpets
and whistles.</p>

<p>On the 19th of May the instruments tested were:</p>

<p>On the top of the cliff:</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Two brass trumpets or horns, 11 feet 2 inches long,
2 inches in diameter at the mouth-piece, and opening out
at the other end to a diameter of 22-1/2 inches. They were
provided with vibrating steel reeds 9 inches long, 2 inches
wide, and 1/4 inch thick, and were sounded by air of 18
lbs. pressure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span></p>

<p><i>b.</i>  A whistle, shaped like that of a locomotive, 6
inches in diameter, also sounded by air of 18 lbs.
pressure.</p>

<p><i>c.</i>  A steam-whistle, 12 inches in diameter, attached to
a boiler, and sounded by steam of 64 lbs. pressure.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the cliff:</p>

<p><i>d.</i>  Two trumpets or horns, of the same size and
arrangement as those above, and sounded by air of the
same pressure. They were mounted vertically on the reservoir
of compressed air; but within about two feet of
their extremities they were bent at a right angle, so as
to present their mouths to the sea.</p>

<p><i>e.</i>  A 6-inch air-whistle, similar to the one above, and
sounded by the same means.</p>

<p>The upper instruments were 235 feet above high-water
mark, the lower ones 40 feet. A vertical distance of 195
feet, therefore, separated the instruments. A shaft, provided
with a series of twelve ladders, led from the one
to the other.</p>

<p>Numerous comparative experiments made at the outset
gave a slight advantage to the upper instruments. They,
therefore, were for the most part employed throughout
the subsequent inquiry.</p>

<p>Our first observations were a preliminary discipline
rather than an organized effort at discovery. On May
19th the maximum distance reached by the sound was
about three and a half miles.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> The wind, however, was
high and the sea rough, so that local noises interfered to
some extent with our appreciation of the sound.</p>

<p>Mariners express the strength of the wind by a series
of numbers extending from 0 = calm to 12 = a hurricane,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>a little practice in common producing a remarkable unanimity
between different observers as regards the force of
the wind. Its force on May 19th was 6, and it blew at
right angles to the direction of the sound.</p>

<p>The same instruments on May 20th covered a greater
range of sound; but not much greater, though the disturbance
due to local noises was absent. At 4 miles’
distance in the axes of the horns they were barely heard,
the air at the time being calm, the sea smooth, and
all other circumstances exactly those which have been
hitherto regarded as most favorable to the transmission
of sound. We crept a little further away, and by
stretched attention managed to hear at intervals, at a distance
of 6 miles, the faintest hum of the horns. A little
further out we again halted; but though local noises were
absent, and though we listened intently, we heard nothing.</p>

<p>This position, clearly beyond the range of whistles and
trumpets, was expressly chosen with the view of making
what might be considered a decisive comparative experiment
between horns and guns as instruments for fog-signalling.
The distinct report of the 12 o’clock gun fired
at Dover on the 19th suggested this comparison, and
through the prompt courtesy of General Sir A. Horsford
we were enabled to carry it out. At 12.30 precisely the
puff of an 18-pounder, with a 3-lb. charge, was seen at
Dover Castle, which was about a mile further off than
the South Foreland. Thirty-six seconds afterward the
loud report of the gun was heard, its complete superiority
over the trumpets being thus, to all appearance,
demonstrated.</p>

<p>We clinched this observation by steaming out to a
distance of 8-1/2 miles, where the report of a second gun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
was well heard by all of us. At a distance of 10 miles
the report of a third gun was heard by some, and at 9·7
miles the report of a fourth gun was heard by all.</p>

<p>The result seemed perfectly decisive. Applying the
law of inverse squares, the sound of the gun at a distance
of 6 miles from the Foreland must have had more
than two and a half times the intensity of the sound of
the trumpets. It would not have been rash under the
circumstances to have reported without qualification the
superiority of the gun as a fog-signal. No single experiment
is, to my knowledge, on record to prove that a
sound once predominant would not be always predominant,
or that the atmosphere on different days would
show preferences to different sounds. On many subsequent
occasions, however, the sound of the horns proved
distinctly superior to that of the gun. This <em>selective</em> power
of the atmosphere revealed itself more strikingly in our
autumn experiments than in our summer ones; and it was
sometimes illustrated within a few hours of the same
day: of two sounds, for example, one might have the
greatest range at 10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, and the other the greatest
range at 2 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span></p>

<p>In the experiments on May 19th and 20th the superiority
of the trumpets over the whistles was decided; and
indeed, with few exceptions, this superiority was maintained
throughout the inquiry. But there were exceptions.
On June 2d, for example, the whistles rose in
several instances to full equality with, and on rare occasions
subsequently even surpassed, the horns. The
sounds were varied from day to day, and various shiftings
of the horns and reeds were resorted to, with a view
of bringing out their maximum power.  On the date last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
mentioned a single horn was sounded, two were sounded,
and three were sounded together; but the utmost range of
the loudest sound, even with the paddles stopped, did not
exceed 6 miles. With the view of concentrating their
power, the axes of the horns had been pointed in the
same direction, and, unless stated to the contrary, this in
all subsequent experiments was the case.</p>

<p>On June 3d the three guns already referred to were
permanently mounted at the South Foreland. They were
ably served by gunners from Dover Castle.</p>

<p>On the same day dense clouds quite covered the firmament,
some of them particularly black and threatening,
but a marked advance was observed in the transmissive
power of the air. At a distance of 6 miles the horn-sounds
were not quite quenched by the paddle-noises; at
8 miles the whistles were heard, and the horns better
heard; while at 9 miles, with the paddles stopped, the
horn-sounds alone were fairly audible. During the day’s
observations a remarkable and instructive phenomenon was
observed. Over us rapidly passed a torrential shower of
rain, which, according to Derham, is a potent damper
of sound. We could, however, notice no subsidence of
intensity as the shower passed. It is even probable that,
had our minds been free from bias, we should have
noticed an augmentation of the sound, such as occurred
with the greatest distinctness on various subsequent occasions
during violent rain.</p>

<p>The influence of “beats” was tried on June 3d, by
throwing the horns slightly out of unison; but though
the beats rendered the sound characteristic, they did not
seem to augment the range. At a distance from the station
curious fluctuations of intensity were noticed. Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
only did the different blasts vary in strength, but sudden
swellings and fallings off, even of the same blast,
were observed. This was not due to any variation on
the part of the instruments, but purely to the changes of
the medium traversed by the sound. What these changes
were shall be indicated subsequently.</p>

<p>The range of our best horns on June 10th was 8-3/4
miles. The guns at this distance were very feeble. That
the loudness of the sound depends on the shape of the
gun was proved by the fact that thus far the howitzer,
with a 3-lb. charge, proved more effective than the other
guns.</p>

<p>On June 25th a gradual improvement in the transmissive
power of the air was observed from morning to evening;
but at the last the maximum range was only moderate.
The fluctuations in the strength of the sound were
remarkable, sometimes sinking to inaudibility and then
rising to loudness. A similar effect, due to a similar
cause, is often noticed with church-bells. The acoustic
transparency of the air was still further augmented on the
26th: at a distance of 9-1/4 miles from the station the whistles
and horns were plainly heard against a wind with a
force of 4; while on the 25th, with a favoring wind, the
maximum range was only 6-1/2 miles. Plainly, therefore,
something else than the wind must be influential in determining
the range of the sound.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, July 1st, observations were made on the
decay of the sound at various angular distances from the
axis of the horn. As might be expected, the sound in
the axis was loudest, the decay being gradual on both
sides. In the case of the gun, however, the direction of
pointing has very little influence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span></p>

<p>The day was acoustically clear; at a distance of 10
miles the horn yielded a plain sound, while the American
whistle seemed to surpass the horn. Dense haze at this
time quite hid the Foreland. At 10-1/2 miles occasional
blasts of the horn came to us, but after a time all sound
ceased to be audible; it seemed as if the air, after having
been exceedingly transparent, had become gradually more
opaque to the sound.</p>

<p>At 4.45 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> we took the master of the Varne light-ship
on board the “Irene.” He and his company had
heard the sound at intervals during the day, although he
was dead to windward and distant 12-3/4 miles from the
source of sound.</p>

<p>Here a word of reflection on our observations may be
fitly introduced. It is, as already shown, an opinion entertained
in high quarters that the waves of sound are
reflected at the limiting surfaces of the minute particles
which constitute haze and fog, the alleged waste of sound
in fog being thus explained. If, however, this be an
efficient practical cause of the stoppage of sound, and if
clear calm air be, as alleged, the best vehicle, it would
be impossible to understand how to-day, in a thick haze,
the sound reached a distance of 12-3/4 miles, while on May
20th, in a calm and hazeless atmosphere, the maximum
range was only from 5 to 6 miles. Such facts foreshadow
a revolution in our notions regarding the action of haze
and fogs upon sound.</p>

<p>An interval of 12 hours sufficed to change in a surprising
degree the acoustic transparency of the air. On
the 1st of July the sound had a range of nearly 13 miles;
on the 2d the range did not exceed 4 miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span></p>

<h4>§ 3. <i>Contradictory Results</i></h4>

<p>Thus far the investigation proceeded with hardly a
gleam of a principle to connect the inconstant results.
The distance reached by the sound on the 19th of May
was 3-1/2 miles; on the 20th it was 5-1/2 miles; on the 2d of
June 6 miles; on the 3d more than 9 miles; on the 10th
it was also 9 miles; on the 25th it fell to 6-1/2 miles; on
the 26th it rose again to more than 9-1/4 miles; on the 1st
of July, as we have just seen, it reached 12-3/4, whereas on
the 2d the range shrunk to 4 miles. None of the meteorological
agents observed could be singled out as the
cause of these fluctuations. The wind exerts an acknowledged
power over sound, but it could not account for
these phenomena. On the 25th of June, for example,
when the range was only 6-1/2 miles, the wind was favorable;
on the 26th, when the range exceeded 9-1/4 miles, it
was opposed to the sound. Nor could the varying optical
clearness of the atmosphere be invoked as an explanation;
for on July 1st, when the range was 12-3/4 miles,
a thick haze hid the white cliffs of the Foreland, while
on many other days, when the acoustic range was not
half so great, the atmosphere was optically clear. Up to
July 3d all remained enigmatical; but on this date observations
were made which seemed to me to displace
surmise and perplexity by the clearer light of physical
demonstration.</p>


<h4>§ 4. <i>Solution of Contradictions</i></h4>

<p>On July 3d we first steamed to a point 2·9 miles
S.W. by W. of the signal-station. No sounds, not even
the guns, were heard at this distance. At 2 miles they
were equally inaudible. But this being a position at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
which the sounds, though strong in the axis of the horn,
invariably subsided, we steamed to the exact bearing
from which our observations had been made on July 1st.
At 2.15 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, and at a distance of 3-3/4 miles from the
station, with calm, clear air and a smooth sea, the horns
and whistle (American) were sounded, but they were inaudible.
Surprised at this result, I signalled for the guns.
They were all fired, but, though the smoke seemed at
hand, no sound whatever reached us. On July 1st, in
this bearing, the observed range of both horns and guns
was 10-1/2 miles, while on the bearing of the Varne light-vessel
it was nearly 13 miles. We steamed in to 3 miles,
paused, and listened with all attention; but neither horn
nor whistle was heard. The guns were again signalled
for; five of them were fired in succession, but not one
of them was heard. We steamed on in the same bearing
to 2 miles, and had the guns fired pointblank at us.
The howitzer and the mortar, with 3-lb. charges, yielded
a feeble thud, while the 18-pounder was wholly unheard.
Applying the law of inverse squares, it follows that, with
the air and sea, according to accepted notions, in a far
worse condition, the sound at 2 miles’ distance on July
1st must have had more than forty times the intensity
which it possessed at the same distance at 3 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> on
the 3d.</p>

<p>“On smooth water,” says Sir John Herschel, “sound
is propagated with remarkable clearness and strength.”
Here was the condition; still, with the Foreland so close
to us, the sea so smooth, and the air so transparent, it
was difficult to realize that the guns had been fired or
the trumpets blown at all. What could be the reason?
Had the sound been converted by internal friction into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
heat? or had it been wasted in partial reflections at the
limiting surfaces of non-homogeneous masses of air? I
ventured, two or three years ago, to say something regarding
the function of the Imagination in Science, and,
notwithstanding the care then taken, to define and illustrate
its real province, some persons, among whom were
one or two able men, deemed me loose and illogical.
They misunderstood me. The faculty to which I referred
was that power of visualizing processes in space, and the
relations of space itself, which must be possessed by all
great physicists and geometers. Looking, for example, at
two pieces of polished steel, we have not a sense, or the
rudiment of a sense, to distinguish the inner condition of
the one from that of the other. And yet they may differ
materially, for one may be a magnet, the other not. What
enabled Ampère to surround the atoms of such a magnet
with channels in which electric currents ceaselessly run,
and to deduce from these pictured currents all the phenomena
of ordinary magnetism? What enabled Faraday
to visualize his lines of force, and make his mental picture
a guide to discoveries which have rendered his name
immortal? Assuredly it was the disciplined imagination.
Figure the observers on the deck of the “Irene,” with
the invisible air stretching between them and the South
Foreland, knowing that it contained something which
stifled the sound, but not knowing what that something
is. Their senses are not of the least use to them; nor
could all the philosophical instruments in the world render
them any assistance. They could not, in fact, take a
single step toward the solution without the formation of
a mental image—in other words, without the exercise
of the imagination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span></p>

<p>Sulphur, in homogeneous crystals, is exceedingly
transparent to radiant heat, whereas the ordinary brimstone
of commerce is highly impervious to it—the reason
being that the brimstone does not possess the molecular
continuity of the crystal, but is a mere aggregate of
minute grains not in perfect optical contact with each
other. Where this is the case, a portion of the heat is
always reflected on entering and on quitting a grain;
hence, when the grains are minute and numerous, this
reflection is so often repeated that the heat is entirely
wasted before it can plunge to any depth into the substance.
The same remark applies to snow, foam, clouds,
and common salt, indeed, to all transparent substances
in powder; they are all impervious to light, not through
the immediate absorption or extinction of the light, but
through repeated internal reflection.</p>

<p>Humboldt, in his observations at the Falls of the
Orinoco, is known to have applied these principles to
sound. He found the noise of the falls far louder by
night than by day, though in that region the night is far
noisier than the day. The plain between him and the
falls consisted of spaces of grass and rock intermingled.
In the heat of the day he found the temperature of the
rock to be considerably higher than that of the grass.
Over every heated rock, he concluded, rose a column of
air rarefied by the heat; its place being supplied by the
descent of heavier air. He ascribed the deadening of the
sound to the reflections which it endured at the limiting
surfaces of the rarer and denser air. This philosophical
explanation made it generally known that a non-homogeneous
atmosphere is unfavorable to the transmission
of sound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span></p>

<p>But what on July 3d, not with the variously-heated
plain of Antures, but with a calm sea as a basis for the
atmosphere, could so destroy its homogeneity as to enable
it to quench in so short a distance so vast a body
of sound? My course of thought at the time was thus
determined: As I stood upon the deck of the “Irene”
pondering the question, I became conscious of the exceeding
power of the sun beating against my back and
heating the objects near me. Beams of equal power were
falling on the sea, and must have produced copious
evaporation. That the vapor generated should so rise
and mingle with the air as to form an absolutely homogeneous
medium, was in the highest degree improbable.
It would be sure, I thought, to rise in invisible streams,
breaking through the superincumbent air now at one
point, now at another, thus rendering the air <em>flocculent</em>
with wreaths and striæ, charged in different degrees with
the buoyant vapor. At the limiting surfaces of these
spaces, though invisible, we should have the conditions
necessary to the production of partial echoes and the consequent
waste of sound. Ascending and descending air-currents,
of different temperatures, as far as they existed,
would also contribute to the effect.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the conditions necessary for the
testing of this explanation immediately set in. At 3.15
<span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> a solitary cloud threw itself athwart the sun, and
shaded the entire space between us and the South Foreland.
The heating of the water and the production of
vapor- and air-currents were checked by the interposition
of this screen; hence the probability of suddenly-improved
transmission. To test this inference, the steamer was immediately
turned and urged back to our last position of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
inaudibility. The sounds, as I expected, were distinctly
though faintly heard. This was at 3 miles’ distance. At
3-3/4 miles, the guns were fired, both pointblank and elevated.
The faintest pop was all that we heard; but we
did hear a pop, whereas we had previously heard nothing,
either here or three-quarters of a mile nearer. We
steamed out to 4-1/4 miles, where the sounds were for a moment
faintly heard; but they fell away as we waited; and
though the greatest quietness reigned on board, and though
the sea was without a ripple, we could hear nothing. We
could plainly see the steam-puffs which announced the beginning
and the end of a series of trumpet-blasts, but the
blasts themselves were quite inaudible.</p>

<p>It was now 4 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>, and my intention at first was to
halt at this distance, which was beyond the sound-range,
but not far beyond it, and see whether the lowering of
the sun would not restore the power of the atmosphere
to transmit the sound. But after waiting a little the
anchoring of a boat was suggested, so as to liberate the
steamer for other work; and though loth to lose the
anticipated revival of the sounds myself, I agreed to this
arrangement. Two men were placed in the boat and requested
to give all attention, so as to hear the sound if
possible. With perfect stillness around them they heard
nothing. They were then instructed to hoist a signal if
they should hear the sounds, and to keep it hoisted as
long as the sounds continued.</p>

<p>At 4.45 we quitted them and steamed toward the
South Sand Head light-ship. Precisely 15 minutes after
we had separated from them the flag was hoisted; the
sound had at length succeeded in piercing the body of
air between the boat and the shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span></p>

<p>We continued our journey to the light-ship, went on
board, heard the report of the lightsmen, and returned to
our anchored boat. We then learned that when the flag
was hoisted the horn-sounds were heard, that they were
succeeded after a little time by the whistle-sounds, and
that both increased in intensity as the evening advanced.
On our arrival, of course, we heard the sounds ourselves.</p>

<p>We pushed the test further by steaming further out.
At 5-3/4 miles we halted and heard the sounds: at 6 miles
we heard them distinctly, but so feebly that we thought
we had reached the limit of the sound-range; but while
we waited the sounds rose in power. We steamed to the
Varne buoy, which is 7-3/4 miles from the signal-station,
and heard the sounds there better than at 6 miles’ distance.
We continued our course outward to 10 miles,
halted there for a brief interval, but heard nothing.</p>

<p>Steaming, however, on to the Varne light-ship, which
is situated at the other end of the Varne shoal, we hailed
the master, and were informed by him that up to 5 <span class="smcap">p.m</span>.
nothing had been heard, but that at that hour the sounds
began to be audible. He described one of them as “very
gross, resembling the bellowing of a bull,” which very
accurately characterizes the sound of the large American
steam-whistle. At the Varne light-ship, therefore, the
sounds had been heard toward the close of the day;
though it is 12-3/4 miles from the signal-station. I think it
probable that, at a point 2 miles from the Foreland, the
sound at 5 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> possessed fifty times the intensity which
it possessed at 2 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> To such undreamed-of fluctuations
is the atmosphere liable. On our return to Dover Bay, at
10 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, we heard the sounds, not only distinct but loud,
where nothing could be heard in the morning.</p>

<h4>§ 5. <i>Other Remarkable Instances of Acoustic Opacity</i></h4>

<p>In his excellent lecture entitled <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“Wirkungen aus der
Ferne,”</span> Dove has collected some striking cases of the
interception of sound. The Duke of Argyll has also
favored me with some highly-interesting illustrations; but
nothing of this description that I have read equals in
point of interest the following account of the battle of
Gaines’s Farm, for which I am indebted to the Rector
of the University of Virginia:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">“Lynchburg, Virginia</span>, <i>March 19, 1874</i>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>—I have just read with great interest your lecture
of January 16th, on the acoustic transparency and
opacity of the atmosphere. The remarkable observations
you mention induce me to state to you a fact which I
have occasionally mentioned, but always, where I am not
well known, with the apprehension that my veracity
would be questioned. It made a strong impression on
me at the time, but was an insoluble mystery until your
discourse gave me a possible solution.</p>

<p>“On the afternoon of June 28, 1862, I rode, in company
with General G. W. Randolph, then Secretary of
War of the Confederate States, to Price’s house, about
nine miles from Richmond; the evening before General
Lee had begun his attack on McClellan’s army, by
crossing the Chickahominy about four miles above Price’s,
and driving in McClellan’s right wing. The battle of
Gaines’s Farm was fought the afternoon to which I refer.
The valley of the Chickahominy is about one mile and a
half wide from hilltop to hilltop. Price’s is on one hilltop,
that nearest to Richmond; Gaines’s farm, just opposite, is
on the other, reaching back in a plateau to Cold Harbor.</p>

<p>“Looking across the valley I saw a good deal of the
battle, Lee’s right resting in the valley, the Federal left
wing the same. My line of vision was nearly in the line
of the lines of battle. I saw the advance of the Confed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>erates,
their repulse two or three times, and in the gray
of the evening the final retreat of the Federal forces.</p>

<p>“I distinctly saw the musket-fire of both lines, the
smoke, individual discharges, the flash of the guns. I
saw batteries of artillery on both sides come into action
and fire rapidly. Several field-batteries on each side were
plainly in sight. Many more were hid by the timber
which bounded the range of vision.</p>

<p>“Yet looking for nearly two hours, from about 5 to 7
<span class="smcap">P.M.</span> on a midsummer afternoon, at a battle in which at
least 50,000 men were actually engaged, and doubtless at
least 100 pieces of field-artillery, through an atmosphere
optically as limpid as possible, <em>not a single sound of the
battle</em> was audible to General Randolph and myself. I
remarked it to him at the time as astonishing.</p>

<p>“Between me and the battle was the deep broad
valley of the Chickahominy, partly a swamp shaded from
the declining sun by the hills and forest in the west
(my side). Part of the valley on each side of the swamp
was cleared; some in cultivation, some not. Here were
conditions capable of providing several belts of air, varying
in the amount of watery vapor (and probably in
temperature), arranged like laminæ at right angles to the
acoustic waves as they came from the battlefield to me.</p>

<p class="center">“Respectfully,</p>

<p class="right padr1">“Your obedient servant,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="right padr1">“<span class="smcap">R. G. H. Kean</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">“Prof. John Tyndall.</span>”</p></blockquote>

<p>I learn from a subsequent letter that during the battle
the air was still.—J. T.</p>


<h4>§ 6. <i>Echoes from Invisible Acoustic Clouds</i></h4>

<p>But both the argument and the phenomena have a
complementary side, which we have now to consider. A
stratum of air less than 3 miles thick on a calm day has
been proved competent to stifle both the cannonade and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
the horn-sounds employed at the South Foreland; while,
according to the foregoing explanation, this result was
due to the reflection of the sound from invisible <em>acoustic
clouds</em> which filled the atmosphere on a day of perfect
<em>optical</em> transparency. But, granting this, it is incredible
that so great a body of sound could utterly disappear in
so short a distance without rendering some account of
itself. Supposing, then, instead of placing ourselves behind
the acoustic cloud, we were to place ourselves
in front of it, might we not, in accordance with the law
of conservation, expect to receive by reflection the sound
which had failed to reach us by transmission? The case
would then be strictly analogous to the reflection of light
from an ordinary cloud to an observer between it and
the sun.</p>

<p>My first care in the early part of the day in question
was to assure myself that our inability to hear the sound
did not arise from any derangement of the instruments
on shore. Accompanied by the private secretary of the
Deputy Master of the Trinity House, at 1 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> I was
rowed to the shore, and landed at the base of the South
Foreland Cliff. The body of air which had already
shown such extraordinary power to intercept the sound,
and which manifested this power still more impressively
later in the day, was now in front of us. On it the
sonorous waves impinged, and from it they were sent
back with astonishing intensity. The instruments, hidden
from view, were on the summit of a cliff 235 feet above
us, the sea was smooth and clear of ships, the atmosphere
was without a cloud, and there was no object in sight
which could possibly produce the observed effect. From
the perfectly transparent air the echoes came, at first with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
a strength apparently little less than that of the direct
sound, and then dying away. A remark made by my
talented companion in his notebook at the time shows
how the phenomenon affected him: “Beyond saying that
the echoes seemed to come from the expanse of ocean, it
did not appear possible to indicate any more definite
point of reflection.” Indeed no such point was to be
seen; the echoes reached us, as if by magic, from the
invisible acoustic clouds with which the optically transparent
atmosphere was filled. The existence of such
clouds in all weathers, whether optically cloudy or
serene, is one of the most important points established
by this inquiry.</p>

<p>Here, in my opinion, we have the key to many of the
mysteries and discrepancies of evidence which beset this
question. The foregoing observations show that there is
no need to doubt either the veracity or the ability of the
conflicting witnesses, for the variations of the atmosphere
are more than sufficient to account for theirs. The mistake,
indeed, hitherto has been, not in reporting incorrectly,
but in neglecting the monotonous operation of
repeating the observations during a sufficient time. I
shall have occasion to remark subsequently on the mischief
likely to arise from giving instructions to mariners
founded on observations of this incomplete character.</p>



<p class="tb">It required, however, long pondering and repeated
observation before this conclusion took firm root in my
mind; for it was opposed to the results of great observers,
and to the statements of celebrated writers. In science
as elsewhere, a mind of any depth which accepts
a doctrine undoubtingly, discards it unwillingly. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
question of aërial echoes has a historic interest. While
cloud-echoes have been accepted as demonstrated by observation,
it has been hitherto held as established that
audible echoes never occur in optically clear air. We
owe this opinion to the admirable report of Arago on
the experiments made to determine the velocity of sound
at Montlhéry and Villejuif in 1822.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> Arago’s account of
the phenomenon observed by him and his colleagues is
as follows: “Before ending this note we will only add
that the shots fired at Montlhéry were accompanied by a
rumbling like that of thunder, which lasted from 20 to
25 seconds. Nothing of this kind occurred at Villejuif.
Once we heard two distinct reports, a second apart, of
the Montlhéry cannon. In two other cases the report
of the same gun was followed by a prolonged rumbling.
These phenomena never occurred without clouds. Under
a clear sky the sounds were single and instantaneous.
May we not, therefore, conclude that the multiple reports
of the Montlhéry gun heard at Villejuif were echoes from
the clouds, and may we not accept this fact as favorable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>to the explanation given by certain physicists of the rolling
of thunder?”</p>

<p>This explanation of the Montlhéry echoes is an inference
from observations made at Villejuif. The inference
requires qualification. Some hundreds of cannon-shots
have been fired at the South Foreland, many of them
when the heavens were completely free from clouds, and
never in a single case has a <em>roulement</em> similar to that
noticed at Montlhéry been absent. It follows, moreover,
so hot upon the direct sound as to present hardly a sensible
breach of continuity between the sound and the
echo. This could not be the case if the clouds were
its origin. A reflecting cloud, at the distance of a mile;
would leave a silent interval of nearly ten seconds between
sound and echo; and had such an interval been
observed at Montlhéry, it could hardly have escaped
record by the philosophers stationed there; but they
have not recorded it.</p>

<p>I think both the fact and the inference need reconsideration.
For our observations prove to demonstration
that air of perfect visual transparency is competent to
produce echoes of great intensity and long duration. The
subject is worthy of additional illustration. On the 8th
of October, as already stated, the siren was established
at the South Foreland. I visited the station on that
day, and listened to its echoes. They were far more
powerful than those of the horn. Like the others, they
were perfectly continuous, and faded, as if into distance,
gradually away. The direct sound seemed rendered complex
and multitudinous by its echoes, which resembled a
band of trumpeters, first responding close at hand, and
then retreating rapidly toward the coast of France. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
siren echoes on that day had 11 seconds’, those of the
horn 8 seconds’, duration.</p>

<p>In the case of the siren, moreover, the reinforcement
of the direct sound by its echo was distinct. About a
second after the commencement of the siren-blast the
echo struck in as a new sound. This first echo, therefore,
must have been flung back by a body of air not
more than 600 or 700 feet in thickness. The few detached
clouds visible at the time were many miles away,
and could clearly have had nothing to do with the effect.</p>

<p>On the 10th of October I was again at the Foreland
listening to the echoes, with results similar to those just
described. On the 15th I had an opportunity of remarking
something new concerning them at Dungeness, where
a horn similar to, but not so powerful as, those at the
South Foreland, has been mounted. It rotates automatically
through an arc of 210°, halting at four different
points on the arc and emitting a blast of 6 seconds’
duration, these blasts being separated from each other
by intervals of silence of 20 seconds.</p>

<p>The new point observed was this: as the horn rotated
the echoes were always returned along the line in which
the axis of the horn pointed. Standing either behind or
in front of the lighthouse tower, or closing the eyes so
as to exclude all knowledge of the position of the horn,
the direction of its axis when sounded could always be
inferred from the direction in which the aërial echoes
reached the shore. Not only, therefore, is knowledge
of <em>direction</em> given by a sound, but it may also be given
by the aërial echoes of the sound.</p>

<p>On the 17th of October, at about 5 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, the air being
perfectly free from clouds, we rowed toward the Foreland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
landed, and passed over the seaweed to the base of the
cliff. As I reached the base the position of the “Galatea”
was such that an echo of astonishing intensity was
sent back from her side; it came as if from an independent
source of sound established on board the steamer.
This echo ceased suddenly, leaving the aërial echoes to
die gradually into silence.</p>

<p>At the base of the cliff a series of concurrent observations
made the duration of the aërial siren-echoes from
13 to 14 seconds.</p>

<p>Lying on the shingle under a projecting roof of chalk,
the somewhat enfeebled diffracted sound reached me, and
I was able to hear with great distinctness, about a second
after the starting of the siren-blast, the echoes striking
in and reinforcing the direct sound. The first rush of
echoed sound was very powerful, and it came, as usual,
from a stratum of air 600 or 700 feet in thickness. On
again testing the duration of the echoes, it was found to
be from 14 to 15 seconds. The perfect clearness of the
afternoon caused me to choose it for the examination of
the echoes. It is worth remarking that this was our day
of longest echoes, and it was also our day of greatest
acoustic transparency, this association suggesting that the
duration of the echo is a measure of the atmospheric
<em>depths</em> from which it comes. On no day, it is to be
remembered, was the atmosphere free from invisible
acoustic clouds; and on this day, and when their presence
did not prevent the direct sound from reaching
to a distance of 15 or 16 nautical miles, they were
able to send us echoes of 15 seconds’ duration.</p>

<p>On various occasions, when fully three miles from the
shore, the Foreland bearing north, we have had the dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>tinct
echoes of the siren sent back to us from the cloudless
<em>southern</em> air.</p>

<p>To sum up this question of aërial echoes. The siren
sounded three blasts a minute, each of 5 seconds’ duration.
From the number of days and the number of
hours per day during which the instrument was in action
we can infer the number of blasts. They reached nearly
twenty thousand. The blasts of the horns exceeded this
number, while hundreds of shots were fired from the
guns. Whatever might be the state of the weather,
cloudy or serene, stormy or calm, the aërial echoes,
though varying in strength and duration from day to
day, were never absent; and on many days, “under a
perfectly clear sky,” they reached, in the case of the
siren, an astonishing intensity. It is doubtless to these
air-echoes, and not to cloud-echoes, that the rolling of
thunder is to be ascribed.</p>


<h4>§ 7. <i>Experimental Demonstration of Reflection from Gases</i></h4>

<p>Thus far we have dealt in inference merely, for the
interception of sound through aërial reflection has never
been experimentally demonstrated; and, indeed, according
to Arago’s observation, which has hitherto held undisputed
possession of the scientific field, it does not sensibly
exist. But the strength of science consists in verification,
and I was anxious to submit the question of
aërial reflection to an experimental test. The knowledge
gained in the last lecture enables us to apply such a
test; but, as in most similar cases, it was not the simplest
combinations that were first adopted. Two gases
of different densities were to be chosen, and I chose carbonic
acid and coal-gas. With the aid of my skillful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
assistant, Mr. John Cottrell, a tunnel was formed, across
which five-and-twenty layers of carbonic acid were permitted
to fall, and five-and-twenty alternate layers of
coal-gas to rise. Sound was sent through this tunnel,
making fifty passages from medium to medium in its
course. These, I thought, would waste in aërial echoes
a sensible portion of sound.</p>

<p>To indicate this waste an objective test was found in
one of the sensitive flames described in the last chapter.
Acquainted with it, we are prepared to understand a
drawing and description of the apparatus first employed
in the demonstration of aërial reflection. The following
clear account of the apparatus was given by a writer
in “Nature,” February 5, 1874:</p>

<p>“A tunnel <i>t t′</i> (<a href="#f146">Fig. 146</a>), 2 inches square, 4 feet 8
inches long, open at both ends, and having a glass front,
runs through the box <i>a b c d</i>. The spaces above and
below are divided into cells opening into the tunnel by
transverse orifices exactly corresponding vertically. Each
alternate cell of the upper series—the 1st, 3d, 5th, etc.—communicates
by a bent tube (<i>e e e</i>) with a common
upper reservoir (<i>g</i>), its counterpart cell in the lower
series having a free outlet into the air. In like manner
the 2d, 4th, 6th, etc., of the lower series of cells are
connected by bent tubes (<i>n n n</i>) with the lower reservoir
(<i>i</i>), each having its direct passage into the air through the
cell immediately above it. The gas-distributors (<i>g</i> and <i>i</i>)
are filled from both ends at the same time, the upper
with carbonic-acid gas, the lower with coal-gas, by
branches from their respective supply-pipes (<i>f</i> and <i>h</i>).
A well-padded box (<span class="smcap">P</span>) open to the end of the tunnel
forms a little cavern, whence the sound-waves are sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a><br /><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>forth by an electric bell (dotted in the figure). A few
feet from the other end of the tunnel, and in a direct
line with it, is a sensitive flame (<i>k</i>), provided with a
funnel as sound-collector, and guarded from chance
currents by a shade.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="f146" id="f146">
<img src="images/i_334.jpg" width="500" height="314" alt="Fig. 146." /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 146.</span></div>
</div>

<p>“The bell was set ringing. The flame, with quick
response to each blow of the hammer, emitted a sort
of musical roar, shortening and lengthening as the successive
sound-pulses reached it. The gases were then
admitted. Twenty-five flat jets of coal-gas ascended from
the tubes below, and twenty-five cascades of carbonic
acid fell from the tubes above. That which was a
homogeneous medium had now fifty limiting surfaces,
from each of which a portion of the sound was thrown
back. In a few moments these successive reflections became
so effective that no sound having sufficient power
to affect the flame could pierce the clear, optically-transparent,
but acoustically-opaque, atmosphere in the tunnel.
So long as the gases continued to flow the flame remained
perfectly tranquil. When the supply was cut off,
the gases rapidly diffused into the air. The atmosphere
of the tunnel became again homogeneous, and therefore
acoustically transparent, and the flame responded to each
sound-pulse as before.”</p>

<p>Not only do gases of different densities act thus upon
sound, but atmospheric air in layers of different temperatures
does the same. Across a tunnel resembling <i>t t′</i>,
<a href="#f146">Fig. 146</a>, sixty-six platinum wires were stretched, all
of them being in metallic connection. The bell, in its
padded box, was placed at one end of the tunnel, and
the sensitive flame <i>k</i>, near its flaring-point, at the other.
When the bell rang the flame flared. A current from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
strong voltaic battery being sent through the platinum
wires, they became heated: layers of warm air rose from
them through the tunnel, and immediately the agitation
of the flame was stilled. On stopping the current, the
agitation recommenced. In this experiment the platinum
wires had not reached a red heat. Employing half the
number and the same battery, they were raised to a red
heat, the action in this case upon the sound-waves being
also energetic. Employing one-third of the number of
wires, and the same strength of battery, the wires were
raised to a white heat. Here also the flame was immediately
rendered tranquil by the stoppage of the sound.</p>


<h4>§ 8. <i>Reflection from Vapors</i></h4>

<p>But not only do gases of different densities, and air
of different temperatures, act thus upon sound, but air
saturated, in different degrees, with the vapors of volatile
liquids can be shown by experiment to produce the same
effect. Into the path pursued by the carbonic acid in our
first experiment a flask, which I have frequently employed
to charge air with vapor, was introduced. Through
a volatile liquid, partially filling the flask, air was forced
into the tunnel <i>t t</i>′, which was thus divided into spaces
of air saturated with the vapor, and other spaces in their
ordinary condition. The action of such a medium upon
the sound-waves issuing from the bell is very energetic,
instantly reducing the violently-agitated flame to stillness
and steadiness. The removal of the heterogeneous medium
instantly restores the noisy flaring of the flame.</p>

<p>A few illustrations of the action of non-homogeneous
atmospheres, produced by the saturation of layers of air
with the vapors of volatile liquids, may follow here:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bisulphide of Carbon.</i>—Flame very sensitive, and
noisily responsive to the sound. The action of the non-homogeneous
atmosphere was prompt and strong, stilling
the agitated flame.</p>

<p><i>Chloroform.</i>—Flame still very sensitive; action similar
to the last.</p>

<p><i>Iodide of Methyl.</i>—Action prompt and energetic.</p>

<p><i>Amylene.</i>—Very fine action; a short and violently-agitated
flame was immediately rendered tall and quiescent.</p>

<p><i>Sulphuric Ether.</i>—Action prompt and energetic.</p>

<p>The vapor of water at ordinary temperatures is so
small in quantity and so attenuated that it requires
special precautions to bring out its action. But with
such precautions it was found competent to reduce to
quiescence the sensitive flame.</p>

<p>As the skill and knowledge of the experimenter augment
he is often able to simplify his experimental combinations.
Thus, in the present instance, by the suitable
arrangement of the source of sound and the sensitive
flame, it was found that not only twenty-five layers, but
three or four layers of coal-gas and carbonic acid sufficed
to still the agitated flame. Nay, with improved manipulation,
the action of a single layer of either gas was
rendered perfectly sensible. So also as regards heated
layers of air, not only were sixty-six or twenty-two
heated platinum wires found sufficient, but the heated air
from two or three candle-flames, or even from a single
flame, or a heated poker, was found perfectly competent
to stop the flame’s agitation. The same remark applies
to vapors. Three or four heated layers of air, saturated
with the vapor of a volatile liquid, stilled the flame;
and, by improved manipulation, the action of a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
saturated layer could be rendered sensible. In all these
cases, moreover, a small, high-pitched reed might be substituted
for the bell.</p>

<p>My assistant has devised the simple apparatus sketched
in Fig. 147, for showing reflection by gases, vapors, and
heated air. At the end <span class="smcap">A</span> of the square pipe <span class="smcap">A B</span>
is a small vibrating reed of high pitch, the sound of
which violently agitates the sensitive flame <i>f</i>. To the
horizontal tube <i>g g′</i> are attached four small burners, and
above them four chimneys, through which the heated
gases from the flames can ascend into <span class="smcap">A B</span>. When the
coverings of the chimneys are removed and the gas is
ignited, the air within <span class="smcap">A B</span> is rendered rapidly non-homogeneous,
and immediately stills the agitated flame.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_338.jpg" width="500" height="326" alt="Fig. 147." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 147.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The pipe <span class="smcap">A B</span> may be turned upside down, an orifice
seen between <span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span> fitting on to the stand which supports
the tube. The conduit <i>t</i> leads into a shallow rectangular
box, which communicates by a series of trans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>verse
apertures with <span class="smcap">A B</span>. When air, saturated with the
vapor of a volatile liquid, is forced through these apertures,
the atmosphere in <span class="smcap">A B</span> is immediately rendered
heterogeneous, the agitated flame being as rapidly stilled.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_339.jpg" width="500" height="304" alt="Fig. 148." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 148.</span></div>
</div>

<p>In the experiments at the South Foreland, not only
was it proved that the acoustic clouds stopped the sound;
but, in the proper position, the sounds which had been
refused transmission were received by reflection. I
wished very much to render this echoed sound evident
experimentally; and stated to my assistant that
we ought to be able to accomplish this. Mr. Cottrell
met my desire by the following beautiful experiment,
which has been thus described before the Royal Society:</p>

<p>A vibrating reed <span class="smcap">B</span> (Fig. 148) was placed so as to
send sound-waves through a tin tube, 38 inches long,
and 1-3/4 inch diameter, in the direction <span class="smcap">B A</span>, the action
of the sound being rendered manifest by its causing a
sensitive flame placed at <span class="smcap">F′</span> to become violently agitated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span></p>

<p>“The invisible heated layer immediately above the
luminous portion of an ignited coal-gas flame issuing
from an ordinary bat’s-wing burner was allowed to
stream upward across the end <span class="smcap">A</span> of the tin tube. A
portion of the sound issuing from the tube was reflected
at the limiting surfaces of the heated layer; the part
transmitted being now only competent to slightly agitate
the sensitive flame at <span class="smcap">F′</span>.</p>

<p>“The heated layer was then placed at such an angle
that the reflected portion of the sound was sent through
a second tin tube, <span class="smcap">A F</span> (of the same dimensions as <span class="smcap">B A</span>).
Its action was rendered visible by causing a second sensitive
flame placed at the end of the tube at <span class="smcap">F</span> to become
violently affected. This <em>echo</em> continued active as long as
the heated layer intervened; but upon its withdrawal the
sensitive flame placed at <span class="smcap">F′</span>, receiving the whole of the
direct pulse, became again violently agitated, and at the
same moment the sensitive flame at <span class="smcap">F</span>, ceasing to be
affected by the echo, resumed its former tranquillity.</p>

<p>“Exactly the same action takes place when the luminous
portion of a gas-flame is made the reflecting layer;
but in the experiments above described the invisible
layer above the flame only was used. By proper adjustment
of the pressure of the gas the flame at <span class="smcap">F′</span> can
be rendered so moderately sensitive to the direct sound-wave
that the portion transmitted through the reflecting
layer shall be incompetent to affect the flame. Then by
the introduction and withdrawal of the bat’s-wing flame
the two sensitive flames can be rendered alternately quiescent
and strongly agitated.</p>

<p>“An illustration is here afforded of the perfect analogy
between light and sound; for if a beam of light be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
projected from <span class="smcap">B</span> to <span class="smcap">F′</span>, and a plate of glass be introduced
at <span class="smcap">A</span> in the exact position of the reflecting layer of gas,
the beam will be divided, one portion being reflected in
the direction <span class="smcap">A F</span>, and the other portion transmitted
through the glass toward <span class="smcap">F′</span>, exactly as the sound-wave
is divided into a reflected and transmitted portion by the
layer of heated gas or flame.”</p>

<p>Thus far, therefore, we have placed our subject in the
firm grasp of experiment; nor shall we find this test failing
us further on.</p>

<h3><i>PART II</i></h3>

<p class="center">INVESTIGATION OF THE CAUSES WHICH HAVE HITHERTO
BEEN SUPPOSED EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING THE TRANSMISSION
OF SOUND THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE</p>


<p class="indent f08">Action of Hail and Rain—Action of Snow—Action of Fog; Observations
in London—Experiments on Artificial Fogs—Observations on Fogs at the
South Foreland—Action of Wind—Atmospheric Selection—Influence of
Sound-Shadow</p>


<h4>§ 1. <i>Action of Hail and Rain</i></h4>

<p>In the first part of this chapter it was demonstrated
that the optic transparency and acoustic transparency
of our atmosphere were by no means necessarily coincident;
that on days of marvellous optical clearness the
atmosphere may be filled with impervious acoustic clouds,
while days optically turbid may be acoustically clear.
We have now to consider, in detail, the influence of
various agents which have hitherto been considered potent
in reference to the transmission of sound through
the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Derham, and after him all other writers, considered
that falling rain tended powerfully to obstruct sound.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
An observation on June 3d has been already referred
to as tending to throw doubt on this conclusion. Two
other crucial instances will suffice to show its untenability.
On the morning of October 8th, at 7.45 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>,
a thunderstorm accompanied by heavy rain broke over
Dover. But the clouds subsequently cleared away, and
the sun shone strongly on the sea. For a time the optical
clearness of the atmosphere was extraordinary, but
it was acoustically opaque. At 2.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> a densely-black
scowl again overspread the heavens to the W.S.W.
The distance being 6 miles, and all hushed on board,
the horn was heard very feebly, the siren more distinctly,
while the howitzer was better than either, though
not much superior to the siren.</p>

<p>A squall approached us from the west. In the Alps
or elsewhere I have rarely seen the heavens blacker.
Vast cumuli floated to the N.E. and S.E.; vast streamers
of rain descended in the W.N.W.; huge scrolls of
cloud hung in the N.; but spaces of blue were to be
seen to the N.N.E.</p>

<p>At 7 miles’ distance the siren and horn were both
feeble, while the gun sent us a very faint report. A
dense shower now enveloped the Foreland.</p>

<p>The rain at length reached us, falling heavily all the
way between us and the Foreland; but the sound, instead
of being deadened, rose perceptibly in power. Hail was
now added to the rain, and the shower reached a tropical
violence, the hailstones floating thickly on the flooded
deck. In the midst of this furious squall both the horns
and the siren were distinctly heard; and as the shower
lightened, thus lessening the local pattering, the sounds so
rose in power that we heard them at a distance of 7-1/2 miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
distinctly louder than they had been heard through the
rainless atmosphere at 5 miles.</p>

<p>At 4 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> the rain had ceased and the sun shone
clearly through the calm air. At 9 miles’ distance the
horn was heard feebly, the siren clearly, while the howitzer
sent us a loud report. All the sounds were better
heard at this distance than they had previously been at
5-1/2 miles; from which, by the law of inverse squares, it
follows that the intensity of the sound at 5-1/2 miles’ distance
must have been augmented at least threefold by the
descent of the rain.</p>

<p>On the 23d of October our steamer had forsaken us
for shelter, and I sought to turn the weather to account
by making other observations on both sides of the fog-signal
station. Mr. Douglass, the chief engineer of the
Trinity House, was good enough to undertake the observations
N.E. of the Foreland; while Mr. Ayers, the assistant
engineer, walked in the other direction. At 12.50
<span class="smcap">P.M.</span> the wind blew a gale, and broke into a thunderstorm
with violent rain. Inside and outside the Cornhill Coast-guard
Station, a mile from the instruments in the direction
of Dover, Mr. Ayers heard the sound of the siren
through the storm; and after the rain had ceased, all
sounds were heard distinctly louder than before. Mr.
Douglass had sent a fly before him to Kingsdown, and
the driver had been waiting for fifteen minutes before
he arrived. During this time no sound had been heard,
though 40 blasts had been blown in the interval; nor had
the coast-guard man on duty, a practiced observer, heard
any of them throughout the day. During the thunderstorm,
and while the rain was actually falling with a
violence which Mr. Douglass describes as perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
torrential, the sounds became audible and were heard
by all.</p>

<p>To rain, in short, I have never been able to trace the
slightest deadening influence upon sound. The reputed
barrier offered by “thick weather” to the passage of sound
was one of the causes which tended to produce hesitation
in establishing sound-signals on our coasts. It is to be
hoped that the removal of this error may redound to the
advantage of coming generations of seafaring men.</p>


<h4>§ 2. <i>Action of Snow</i></h4>

<p>Falling snow, according to Derham, is the most serious
obstacle of all to the transmission of sound. We did
not extend our observations at the South Foreland into
snowy weather; but a previous observation of my own
bears directly upon this point. On Christmas night, 1859,
I arrived at Chamouni, through snow so deep as to obliterate
the road-fences, and to render the labor of reaching
the village arduous in the extreme. On the 26th and
27th it fell heavily. On the 27th, during a lull in the
storm, I reached the Montavert, sometimes breast deep in
snow. On the 28th, with great difficulty, two lines of
stakes were set out across the glacier, with the view
of determining its winter motion. On the 29th the entry
in my journal, written in the morning, is: “Snow, heavy
snow; it must have descended through the entire night,
the quantity freshly fallen is so great.”</p>

<p>Under these circumstances I planted my theodolite
beside the Mer de Glace, having waded to my position
through snow, which, being dry, reached nearly to my
breast. Assistants were sent across the glacier with instructions
to measure the displacement of a transverse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
line of stakes planted previously in the snow. A storm
drifted up the valley, darkening the air as it approached.
It reached us, the snow falling more heavily than I had
ever seen it elsewhere. It soon formed a heap on the
theodolite, and thickly covered my own clothes. Here,
then, was a combination of snow in the air, and of soft
fresh snow on the ground, such as Derham could hardly
have enjoyed; still through such an atmosphere I was
able to make my instructions audible quite across the
glacier, the distance being half a mile, while the experiment
was rendered reciprocal by one of my assistants
making his voice audible to me.</p>


<h4>§ 3. <i>Passage of Sound through Textile Fabrics, and
through Artificial Showers</i></h4>

<p>The flakes here were so thick that it was only at intervals
that I was able to pick up the retreating forms of
the men. Still the air through which the flakes fell was
continuous. Did the flakes merely yield passively to the
sonorous waves, swinging like the particles of air themselves
to and fro as the sound-waves passed them? Or
did the waves bend by diffraction round the flakes, and
emerge from them without sensible loss? Experiment
will aid us here by showing the astonishing facility with
which sound makes its way among obstacles, and passes
through tissues, so long as the continuity of the air in
their interstices is preserved.</p>

<p>A piece of millboard or of glass, a plank of wood,
or the hand, placed across the open end <i>t′</i> of the tunnel
<i>a b c d</i>, <a href="#f146">Fig. 146</a> (page 334), intercepts the sound of the
bell, placed in the padded box <span class="smcap">P</span>, and stills the sensitive
flame <i>k</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span></p>

<p>An ordinary cambric pocket-handkerchief, on the other
hand, placed across the tunnel-end produced hardly an
appreciable effect upon the sound. Through two layers
of the handkerchief the flame was strongly agitated;
through four layers it was still agitated; while through
six layers, though nearly stilled, it was not entirely so.</p>

<p>Dipping the same handkerchief into water, and stretching
a single wetted layer across the tunnel-end, it stilled
the flame as effectually as the millboard or the wood.
Hence the conclusion that the sound-waves in the first
instance passed through the interstices of the cambric.</p>

<p>Through a single layer of thin silk the sound passed
without sensible interruption; through six layers the
flame was strongly agitated; while through twelve layers
the agitation was quite perceptible.</p>

<p>A single layer of this silk, when wetted, stilled the
flame.</p>

<p>A layer of soft lint produced but little effect upon
the sound; a layer of thick flannel was almost equally
ineffectual. Through four layers of flannel the flame was
perceptibly agitated. Through a single layer of green
baize the sound passed almost as freely as through air;
through four layers of the baize the action was still sensible.
Through a layer of close hard felt, half an inch
thick, the sound-waves passed with sufficient energy to
sensibly agitate the flame. Through 200 layers of cotton-net
the sound passed freely. I did not witness these
effects without astonishment.</p>

<p>A single layer of thin oiled silk stopped the sound
and stilled the flame. A leaf of common note-paper, or
a five-pound note, also stopped the sound.</p>

<p>The sensitive flame is not absolutely necessary to these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
experiments. Let a ticking watch be hung six inches
from the ear, a cambric handkerchief dropped between it
and the ear scarcely sensibly affects the ticking; a sheet
of oil-skin or an intensely heated gas-column cuts it
almost wholly off.</p>

<p>But though oiled silk, foreign post, or a banknote,
can stop the sound, a film sufficiently thin to yield freely
to the aërial pulses transmits it. A thick soap-film produces
an obvious effect upon the sensitive flame; a very
thin one does not. The augmentation of the transmitted
sound may be observed simultaneously with the generation
and brightening of the colors which indicate the increasing
thinness of the film.  A very thin collodion-film
acts in the same way.</p>

<p>Acquainted with the foregoing facts regarding the passage
of sound through cambric, silk, lint, flannel, baize,
felt, and cotton-net, you are prepared for the statement
that the sound-waves pass without sensible impediment
through heavy artificial showers of rain, hail, and snow.
Water-drops, seeds, sand, bran, and flocculi of various
kinds, have been employed to form such showers;
through all of these, as through the actual rain and hail
already described, and through the snow on the Mer de
Glace, the sound passes without sensible obstruction.</p>


<h4>§ 4. <i>Action of Fog.  Observations in London</i></h4>

<p>But the mariner’s greatest enemy, fog, is still to be
dealt with; and here for a long time the proper conditions
of experiment were absent. Up to the end of November
we had had frequent days of haze, sufficiently thick
to obscure the white cliffs of the Foreland, but no real
fog. Still those cases furnished demonstrative evidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
that the notions entertained regarding the reflection of
sound by suspended particles were wrong; for on many
days of the thickest haze the sound covered twice the
range attained on other days of perfect optical transparency.
Such instances dissolved the association hitherto
assumed to exist between acoustic transparency and optic
transparency, but they left the action of dense fogs undetermined.</p>

<p>On December 9th a memorable fog settled down on
London. I addressed a telegram to the Trinity House
suggesting some gun observations. With characteristic
promptness came the reply that they would be made in
the afternoon at Blackwall. I went to Greenwich in the
hope of hearing the guns across the river; but the delay
of the train by the fog rendered my arrival too late.
Over the river the fog was very dense, and through it
came various sounds with great distinctness. The signal-bell
of an unseen barge rang clearly out at intervals, and
I could plainly hear the hammering at Cubitt’s Town,
half a mile away, on the opposite side of the river. No
deadening of the sound by the fog was apparent.</p>

<p>Through this fog and various local noises, Captain Atkins
and Mr. Edwards heard the report of a 12-pounder
carronade with a 1-lb. charge distinctly better than the
18-pounder with a 3-lb. charge, an optically clear atmosphere,
and all noises absent, on July 3d.</p>

<p>Anxious to turn to the best account a phenomenon
for which we had waited so long, I tried to grapple with
the problem by experiments on a small scale. On the
10th, I stationed my assistant with a whistle and organ-pipe
on the walk below the southwest end of the bridge
dividing Hyde Park from Kensington Gardens. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
the eastern end of the Serpentine I heard distinctly both
the whistle and the pipe, which produced 380 waves a
second. On changing places with my assistant, I heard
for a time the distinct blast of the whistle only. The
deeper note of the organ-pipe at length reached me, rising
sometimes to great distinctness, and sometimes falling
to inaudibility. The whistle showed the same intermittence
as to period, but in an opposite sense; for, when
the whistle was faint, the pipe was strong, and <em>vice versa</em>.
To obtain the fundamental note of the pipe, it had to be
blown gently, and on the whole the whistle proved the
most efficient in piercing the fog.</p>

<p>An extraordinary amount of sound filled the air during
these experiments. The resonant roar of the Bayswater
and Knightsbridge roads; the clangor of the great
bell of Westminster; the railway-whistles, which were frequently
blown, and the fog-signals exploded at the various
metropolitan stations, were all heard with extraordinary
intensity. This could by no means be reconciled
with the statements so categorically made regarding the
acoustic impenetrability of a London fog.</p>

<p>On the 11th of December, the fog being denser than
before, I heard every blast of the whistle, and occasional
blasts of the pipe, over the distance between the bridge
and the eastern end of the Serpentine. On joining my
assistant at the bridge, the loud concussion of a gun was
heard by both of us. A police-inspector affirmed that it
came from Woolwich, and that he had heard several shots
about 2 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> and previously. The fact, if a fact, was of
the highest importance; so I immediately telegraphed to
Woolwich for information. Prof. Abel kindly furnished
me with the following particulars:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span></p>

<p>“The firing took place at 1.40 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> The guns proved
were of comparatively small size—64-pounders, with 10-lb.
charges of powder.</p>

<p>“The concussion experienced at my house and office,
about three-quarters of a mile from the butt, was decidedly
more severe than that experienced when the
heaviest guns are proved with charges of 110 to 120
lbs. of powder. There was a dense fog here at the time
of firing.”</p>

<p>These were the guns heard by the police-inspector; on
subsequent inquiry it was ascertained that two guns were
fired about 3 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> These were the guns heard by myself.</p>

<p>Prof. Abel also communicated to me the following
fact: “Our workman’s bell at the Arsenal Gate, which
is of moderate size and anything but clear in tone, is
pretty distinctly heard by Prof. Bloxam <em>only</em> when the
wind is <em>northeast</em>. During the whole of last week the
bell was heard with great distinctness, the wind being
<em>southwesterly</em> (opposed to the sound). The distance of
the bell from Bloxam’s house is about three-quarters
of a mile as the crow flies.”</p>

<p>Assuredly no question of science ever stood so much
in need of revision as this of the transmission of sound
through the atmosphere. Slowly, but surely, we mastered
the question; and the further we advanced, the
more plainly it appeared that our reputed knowledge
regarding it was erroneous from beginning to end.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 12th the fog attained its maximum
density. It was not possible to read at my window,
which fronted the open western sky. At 10.30 I sent an
assistant to the bridge, and listened for his whistle and
pipe at the eastern end of the Serpentine. The whistle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
rose to a shrillness far surpassing anything previously
heard, but it sank sometimes almost to inaudibility;
proving that, though the air was on the whole highly
homogeneous, acoustic clouds still drifted through the
fog. A second pipe, which was quite inaudible yesterday,
was plainly heard this morning. We were able to
discourse across the Serpentine to-day with much greater
ease than yesterday.</p>

<p>During our summer observations I had once or twice
been able to fix the position of the Foreland in thick
haze by the direction of the sound. To-day my assistant,
hidden by the fog, walked up to the Watermen’s
Boathouse sounding his whistle; and I walked along the
opposite side of the Serpentine, clearly appreciating for
a time that the line joining us was oblique to the axis
of the river. Coming to a point which seemed to be
exactly abreast of him, I marked it; and on the following
day, when the fog had cleared away, the marked
position was found to be perfectly exact. When undisturbed
by echoes, the ear, with a little practice, becomes
capable of fixing with great precision the direction of
a sound.</p>

<p>On reaching the Serpentine this morning, a peal of
bells, which then began to ring, seemed so close at hand
that it required some reflection to convince me that they
were ringing to the north of Hyde Park. The sounds
fluctuated wonderfully in power. Prior to the striking
of eleven by the great bell of Westminster, a nearer
bell struck with loud clangor. The first five strokes of
the Westminster bell were afterward heard, one of them
being extremely loud; but the last six strokes were inaudible.
An assistant was stationed to attend to the 12<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
o’clock bells. The clock which had struck so loudly at
11 was unheard at 12, while of the Westminster bell eight
strokes out of twelve were inaudible. To such astonishing
changes is the atmosphere liable.</p>

<p>At 7 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> the Westminster bell, striking seven, was
not at all heard from the Serpentine, while the nearer
bell already alluded to was heard distinctly. The fog
had cleared away, and the lamps on the bridge could
be seen from the eastern end of the Serpentine burning
brightly; but, instead of the sound sharing the improvement
of the light, what might be properly called an
acoustic fog took the place of its optical predecessor.
Several series of the whistle and organ-pipe were sounded
in succession; one series only of the whistle-sounds was
heard, all the others being quite inaudible. Three series
of the organ-pipe were heard, but very faintly. On reversing
the positions and sounding as before, nothing
whatever was heard.</p>

<p>At 8 o’clock the chimes and hour-bell of the Westminster
clock were both very loud. The “acoustic fog”
had shifted its position, or temporarily melted away.</p>

<p>Extraordinary fluctuations were also observed in the
case of the church-bells heard in the morning: in a few
seconds they would sink from a loudly ringing-peal into
utter silence, from which they would rapidly return to
loud-tongued audibility. The intermittent drifting of fog
over the sun’s disk (by which his light is at times obscured,
at times revealed) is the optical analogue of these
effects. As regards such changes, the acoustic deportment
of the atmosphere is a true transcript of its optical
deportment.</p>

<p>At 9 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> three strokes only of the Westminster clock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
were heard; the others were inaudible. The air had relapsed
in part into its condition at 7 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, when all the
strokes were unheard. The quiet of the park this evening,
as contrasted with the resonant roar which filled the
air on the two preceding days, was very remarkable.
The sound, in fact, was stifled in the optically clear
but acoustically flocculent atmosphere.</p>

<p>On the 13th, the fog being displaced by thin haze, I
went again to the Serpentine. The carriage-sounds were
damped to an extraordinary degree. The roar of the
Knightsbridge and Bayswater roads had subsided, the
tread of troops which passed us a little way off was
unheard, while at 11 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> both the chimes and the hour-bell
of the Westminster clock were stifled. Subjectively
considered, all was favorable to auditory impressions; but
the very cause that damped the local noises extinguished
our experimental sounds. The voice across the Serpentine
to-day, with my assistant plainly visible in front of
me, was distinctly feebler than it had been when each
of us was hidden from the other in the densest fog.</p>

<p>Placing the source of sound at the eastern end of the
Serpentine I walked along its edge from the bridge toward
the end. The distance between these two points is
about 1,000 paces. After 500 of them had been stepped,
the sound was not so distinct as it had been at the
bridge on the day of densest fog; hence, by the law of
inverse squares, the optical cleansing of the air through
the melting away of the fog had so darkened it acoustically
that a sound generated at the eastern end of the
Serpentine was lowered to one-fourth of its intensity at
a point midway between the end and the bridge.</p>

<p>To these demonstrative observations one or two sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>sequent
ones may be added. On several of the moist
and warm days, at the beginning of 1874, I stood at
noon beside the railing of St. James’s Park, near Buckingham
Palace, three-quarters of a mile from the clock-tower,
which was clearly visible. Not a single stroke of
“Big Ben” was heard. On January 19th fog and drizzling
rain obscured the tower; still from the same position
I not only heard the strokes of the great bell, but
also the chimes of the quarter-bells.</p>

<p>During the exceedingly dense and “dripping” fog of
January 22d, from the same railings, I heard every stroke
of the bell. At the end of the Serpentine, when the fog
was densest, the Westminster bell was heard striking
loudly eleven. Toward evening this fog began to melt
away, and at 6 o’clock I went to the end of the Serpentine
to observe the effect of the optical clearing upon the
sound. Not one of the strokes reached me. At 9
o’clock and at 10 o’clock my assistant was in the same
position, and on both occasions he failed to hear a single
stroke of the bell. It was a case precisely similar to that
of December 13th, when the dissolution of the fog was
accompanied by a decided acoustic thickening of the air.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></p>


<h4>§ 5. <i>Observations at the South Foreland</i></h4>

<p>Satisfactory, and indeed conclusive, as these results
seemed, I desired exceedingly to confirm them by experiments
with the instruments actually employed at the
South Foreland. On the 10th of February I had the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>gratification of receiving the following note and inclosure
from the Deputy Master of Trinity House:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Tyndall</span>—The inclosed will show how
accurately your views have been verified, and I send
them on at once without waiting for the details. I think
you will be glad to have them, and as soon as I get the
report it shall be sent to you. I made up my mind ten
days ago that there would be a chance in the light
foggy-disposed weather at home, and therefore sent the
‘Argus’ off at an hour’s notice, and requested the Fog
Committee to keep one member on board. On Friday I
was so satisfied that the fog would occur that I sent
Edwards down to record the observations.</p>

<p class="right padr3">“Very truly yours,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="right padr1">“<span class="smcap">Fred. Arrow</span>.”</p>

<p>The inclosure referred to was notes from Captain
Atkins and Mr. Edwards. Captain Atkins writes thus:</p>

<p>“As arranged, I came down here by the mail express,
meeting Mr. Edwards at Cannon Street. We put up at
the Dover Castle, and next morning at 7 I was awoke by
sounds of the siren. On jumping up I discovered that
the long-looked-for fog had arrived, and that the ‘Argus’
had left her moorings.</p>

<p>“However, had I been on board, the instructions I
left with Troughton (the master of the ‘Argus’) could not
have been better carried out. About noon the fog cleared
up, and the ‘Argus’ returned to her moorings, when I
learned that they had taken both siren and horn sounds
to a distance of 11 miles from the station, where they
dropped a buoy. This I knew to be correct, as I have
this morning recovered the buoy, and the distances both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
in and out agree with Troughton’s statement. I have
also been to the Varne light-ship (12-3/4 miles from the Foreland),
and ascertained that during the fog of Saturday
forenoon they ‘distinctly’ heard the sounds.”</p>



<p class="tb">Mr. Edwards, who was constantly at my side during
our summer and autumn observations, and who is thoroughly
competent to form a comparative estimate of the
strength of the sounds, states that those of the 7th were
“extraordinarily loud,” both Captain Atkins and himself
being awoke by them. He does not remember ever before
hearing the sounds so loud in Dover; it seemed as
though the observers were close to the instruments.</p>

<p>Other days of fog preceded this one, and they were all
days of acoustic transparency, the day of densest fog being
acoustically the clearest of all.</p>

<p>The results here recorded are of the highest importance,
for they bring us face to face with a dense fog
and an actual fog-signal, and confirm in the most conclusive
manner the previous observations. The fact of
Captain Atkins and Mr. Edwards being awakened by
the siren proves, beyond all our previous experience, its
power during this dense fog.</p>

<p>It is exceedingly interesting to compare the transmission
of sound on February 7th with its transmission on
October 14th. The wind on both days had the same
strength and direction. My notes of the observations
show the latter to have been throughout a day of extreme
optical clearness. The range was 10 miles. During
the fog of February 7th the “Argus” heard the sound
at 11 miles; and it was also heard at the Varne light-vessel,
which is 12-3/4 miles from the Foreland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span></p>

<p>It is also worthy of note that through the same fog
the sounds were well heard at the South Sand Head light-vessel,
which is in the opposite direction from the South
Foreland, and was actually behind the siren. For this
important circumstance is to be borne in mind: on February
7th the siren happened to be pointed, not toward
the “Argus,” but toward Dover. Had the yacht been in
the axis of the instrument it is highly probable that the
sound would have been heard all the way across to the
coast of France.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary for me to say a word to guard
myself against the misconception that I consider sound to
be assisted by the fog itself. The fog-particles have no
more influence upon the waves of sound than the suspended
particles stirred up over the banks of Newfoundland
have upon the waves of the Atlantic. A homogeneous
air is the usual associate of fog, and hence the
acoustic clearness of foggy weather.</p>


<h4>§ 6. <i>Experiments on Artificial Fogs</i></h4>

<p>These observations are clinched and finished by being
brought within the range of laboratory experiment. Here
we shall learn incidentally a lesson as to the caution
required from an experimenter.</p>

<p>The smoke from smouldering brown paper was allowed
to stream upward through its rectangular apertures, into
the tunnel <i>a b c d</i> (Fig. 146); the action upon the sound-waves
was strong, rendering the short and agitated sensitive
flame <i>k</i> tall and quiescent.</p>

<p>Air first passed through ammonia, then through hydrochloric
acid, and, thus loaded with thick fumes, was sent
into the tunnel; the agitated flame was rendered imme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>diately
quiescent, indicating a very decided action on the
part of the artificial fog.</p>

<p>Air passed through perchloride of tin and sent into
the tunnel produced exceedingly dense fumes. The action
upon the sound-waves was very strong.</p>

<p>The dense smoke of resin, burned before the open end
of the tunnel, and blown into it with a pair of bellows,
had also the effect of stopping the sound-waves, so as to
still the agitated flame.</p>

<p>The conclusion seems clear, and its perfect harmony
with the prevalent <em>à priori</em> notions as to the action of
fog upon sound makes it almost irresistible. But caution
is here necessary. The smoke of the brown paper was
<em>hot</em>; the flask containing the hydrochloric acid was <em>hot</em>;
that containing the perchloride of tin was <em>hot</em>; while the
resin fumes produced by a red-hot poker were also obviously
hot. Were the results, then, due to the fumes
or to the differences of temperature? The observations
might well have proved a trap to an incautious reasoner.</p>

<p>Instead of the smoke and heated air, the heated air
alone from four red-hot pokers was permitted to stream
upward into the tunnel; the action on the sound-waves
was very decided, though the tunnel was optically empty.
The flame of a candle was placed at the upper end, and
the hot air just above its tip was blown into the tunnel;
the action on the sensitive flame was decided. A similar
effect was produced when the air, ascending from a red-hot
iron, was blown into the tunnel.</p>

<p>In these latter cases the tunnel remained optically
clear, while the same effect as that produced by the resin,
smoke, and fumes was observed. Clearly, then, we are
not entitled to ascribe, without further investigation, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
the artificial fog an effect which may have been due
to the air which accompanied it.</p>

<p>Having eliminated the fog and proved the non-homogeneous
air effective, our reasoning will be completed by
eliminating the heat, and proving the fog ineffective.</p>

<p>Instead of the tunnel <i>a b c d</i>, Fig. 146, a cupboard
with glass sides, 3 feet long, 2 feet wide, and about 5
feet high, was filled with fumes of various kinds. Here
it was thought the fumes might remain long enough for
differences of temperature to disappear. Two apertures
were made in two opposite panes of glass 3 feet asunder.
In front of one aperture was placed the bell in its
padded box, and behind the other aperture, and at some
distance from it, the sensitive flame.</p>

<p>Phosphorus placed in a cup floating on water was
ignited within the closed cupboard. The fumes were
so dense that considerably less than the three feet
traversed by the sound extinguished totally a bright
candle-flame.</p>

<p>At first there was a slight action upon the sound; but
this rapidly vanished, the flame being no more affected
than if the sound had passed through pure air. The first
action was manifestly due to differences of temperature,
and it disappeared when the temperature was equalized.</p>

<p>The cupboard was next filled with the dense fumes of
gunpowder. At first there was a slight action; but this
disappeared even more rapidly than in the case of the
phosphorus, the sound passing as if no fumes were there.
It required less than half a minute to abolish the action
in the case of the phosphorus, but a few seconds sufficed
in the case of the gunpowder. These fumes were far
more than sufficient to quench the candle-flame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span></p>

<p>The dense smoke of resin, when the temperature had
become equable, exerted no action on the sound.</p>

<p>The fumes of gum-mastic were equally ineffectual.</p>

<p>The fumes of the perchloride of tin, though of extraordinary
density, exerted no sensible effect upon the
sound.</p>

<p>Exceedingly dense fumes of chloride of ammonium
next filled the cupboard. A fraction of the length of
the 3-foot tube sufficed to quench the candle-flame. Soon
after the cupboard was filled, the sound passed without
the least sensible deterioration. An aperture at the top
of the cupboard was opened; but though a dense smoke-column
ascended through it, many minutes elapsed before
the candle-flame could be seen through the attenuated
fog.</p>

<p>Steam from a copper boiler was so copiously admitted
into the cupboard as to fill it with a dense cloud. No
real cloud was ever so dense; still the sound passed
through it without the least sensible diminution. This
being the case, cloud-echoes are not a likely phenomenon.</p>

<p>In all of these cases, when a couple of Bunsen’s
burners were ignited within the cupboard containing the
fumes, less than a minute’s action rendered the air so
heterogeneous that the sensitive flame was completely
stilled.</p>

<p>These acoustically inactive fogs were subsequently
proved competent to cut off the electric light.</p>

<p>Experiment and observation go, therefore, hand in
hand in demonstrating that fogs have no sensible action
upon sound. The notion of their impenetrability, which
so powerfully retarded the introduction of phonic coast-signals,
being thus abolished, we have solid ground for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
the hope that disasters due to fogs and thick weather
will in the future be materially mitigated.</p>


<h4>§ 7. <i>Action of Wind</i></h4>

<p>In stormy weather we were frequently forsaken by
our steamer, which had to seek shelter in the Downs or
Margate Roads, and on such occasions the opportunity
was turned to account to determine the effect of the
wind. On October 11th, accompanied by Mr. Douglass
and Mr. Edwards, I walked along the cliffs from Dover
Castle toward the Foreland, the wind blowing strongly
against the sound. About a mile and a half from the
Foreland, we first heard the faint but distinct sound of
the siren. The horn-sound was inaudible. A gun fired
during our halt was also unheard.</p>

<p>As we approached the Foreland we saw the smoke of
a gun. Mr. Edwards heard a faint crack, but neither
Mr. Douglass nor I heard anything. The sound of the
siren was at the same time of piercing intensity. We
waited for ten minutes, when another gun was fired.
The smoke was at hand, and I thought I heard a faint
thud, but could not be certain. My companions heard
nothing. On pacing the distance afterward we were
found to be only 550 yards from the gun. We were
shaded at the time by a slight eminence from both the
siren and the gun, but this could not account for the utter
extinction of the gun-sound at so short a distance, and at
a time when the siren sent to us a note of great power.</p>

<p>Mr. Ayres at my request walked windward along the
cliff, while Mr. Douglass proceeded to St. Margaret’s Bay.
During their absence I had three guns fired. Mr. Ayres
heard only one of them.  Favored by the wind, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
Douglass, at twice the distance, and far more deeply
immersed in the sound-shadow, heard all three reports
with the utmost distinctness.</p>

<p>Joining Mr. Douglass, we continued our walk to a
distance of three-quarters of a mile beyond St. Margaret’s
Bay. Here, being dead to leeward, though the
wind blew with unabated violence, the sound of the siren
was borne to us with extraordinary power.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> In this position
we also heard the gun loudly, and two other loud
reports at the proper interval of ten minutes, as we returned
to the Foreland.</p>

<p>It is within the mark to say that the gun on October
11th was heard five times, and might have been heard
fifteen times, as far to leeward as to windward.</p>

<p>In windy weather the shortness of its sound is a serious
drawback to the use of the gun as a signal. In the
case of the horn and siren, time is given for the attention
to be fixed upon the sound; and a single puff, while
cutting out a portion of the blast, does not obliterate it
wholly. Such a puff, however, may be fatal to the
momentary gun-sound.</p>

<p>On the leeward side of the Foreland, on the 23d of
October, the sounds were heard at least four times as far
as on the windward side, while in both directions the
siren possessed the greatest penetrative power.</p>

<p>On the 24th the wind shifted to E.S.E., and the
sounds, which, when the wind was W.S.W., failed to
reach Dover, were now heard in the streets through
thick rain. On the 27th the wind was E.N.E. In our
writing-room in the Lord Warden Hotel, in the bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>rooms,
and on the staircase, the sound of the siren
reached us with surprising power, piercing through the
whistling and moaning of the wind, which blew through
Dover toward Folkestone. The sounds were heard by
Mr. Edwards and myself at 6 miles from the Foreland on
the Folkestone road; and had the instruments not then
ceased sounding, they might have been heard much
further. At the South Sand Head light-vessel, 3-3/4 miles
on the opposite side, no sound had been heard throughout
the day. On the 28th, the wind being N. by E., the
sounds were heard in the middle of Folkestone, 8 miles
off, while in the opposite direction they failed to reach
3-3/4 miles. On the 29th the limits of range were Eastware
Bay on the one side, and Kingsdown on the other; on the
30th the limits were Kingsdown on the one hand, and
Folkestone Pier on the other. With a wind having a force
of 4 or 5 it was a very common observation to hear the
sound in one direction three times as far as in the other.</p>

<p>This well-known effect of the wind is exceedingly
difficult to explain. Indeed, the only explanation worthy
of the name is one offered by Prof. Stokes, and suggested
by some remarkable observations of De la Roche.
In Vol. I. of “Annales de Chimie” for 1816, p. 176,
Arago introduces De la Roche’s memoir in these words:
“L’auteur arrive à des conclusions, qui d’abord pourront
paraître paradoxales, mais ceux qui savent combien il
mettait de soins et d’exactitude dans toutes ses recherches
se garderont sans doute d’opposer une opinion populaire
à des expériences positives.” The strangeness of
De la Roche’s results consisted in his establishing, by
quantitative measurements, not only that sound has a
greater range in the direction of the wind than in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
opposite direction, but that the range at right angles to
the wind is the maximum.</p>

<p>In a short but exceedingly able communication, presented
to the British Association in 1857, the eminent
physicist above mentioned points out a cause which, <em>if
sufficient</em>, would account for the results referred to. The
lower atmospheric strata are retarded by friction against
the earth, and the upper ones by those immediately
below them; the velocity of transition, therefore, in the
case of wind, increases from the ground upward. It may
be proved that this difference of velocity tilts the sound-wave
upward in a direction opposed to, and downward in
a direction coincident with, the wind. In this latter case
the direct wave is reinforced by the wave reflected from
the earth. Now the reinforcement is greatest in the
direction in which the direct and reflected waves inclose
the smallest angle; and this is at right angles to the direction
of the wind. Hence the greater range in this direction.
It is not, therefore, according to Prof. Stokes, a
stifling of the sound to windward, but a tilting of the
sound-wave over the heads of the observers, that defeats
the propagation in that direction.</p>

<p>This explanation calls for verification, and I wished
much to test it by means of a captive balloon rising high
enough to catch the deflected wave; but on communicating
with Mr. Coxwell, who has earned for himself so
high a reputation as an aeronaut, and who has always
shown himself so willing to promote a scientific object, I
learned with regret that the experiment was too dangerous
to be carried out.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span></p>

<h4>§ 8. <i>Atmospheric Selection</i></h4>

<p>It has been stated that the atmosphere on different
days shows preferences to different sounds. This point is
worthy of further illustration.</p>

<p>After the violent shower which passed over us on
October 18th, the sounds of all the instruments, as already
stated, rose in power; but it was noticed that the
horn-sound, which was of lower pitch than that of the
siren, improved most, at times not only equalling, but
surpassing, the sound of its rival. From this it might
be inferred that the atmospheric change produced by the
rain favored more especially the transmission of the longer
sonorous waves.</p>

<p>But our programme enabled us to go further than
mere inference. It had been arranged on the day mentioned
that up to 3.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> the siren should perform 2,400
revolutions a minute, generating 480 waves a second. As
long as this rate continued, the horn, after the shower,
had the advantage. The rate of rotation was then
changed to 2,000 a minute, or 400 waves a second, when
the siren-sound immediately surpassed that of the horn.
A clear connection was thus established between aërial
reflection and the length of the sonorous waves.</p>

<p>The 10-inch Canadian whistle being capable of adjustment
so as to produce sounds of different pitch, on the
10th of October I ran through a series of its sounds.
The shrillest appeared to possess great intensity and
penetrative power. The belief is common that a note of
this character (which affects so powerfully, and even
painfully, an observer close at hand) has also the greatest
range. Mr. A. Gordon, in his examination before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
Committee on Lighthouses, in 1845, expressed himself
thus: “When you get a shrill sound, high in the scale,
that sound is carried much further than a lower note in
the scale.” I have heard the same opinion expressed by
other scientific men.</p>

<p>On the 14th of October the point was submitted to an
experimental test. It had been arranged that up to 11.30
<span class="smcap">A.M.</span> the Canadian whistle, which had been heard with
such piercing intensity on the 10th, should sound its
shrillest note. At the hour just mentioned we were beside
the Varne buoy, 7-3/4 miles from the Foreland. The
siren, as we approached the buoy, was heard through the
paddle-noises; the horns were also heard, but more feebly
than the siren. We paused at the buoy and listened for
the 11.30 gun. Its boom was heard by all. Neither before
nor during the pause was the shrill-sounding Canadian
whistle once heard. At the appointed time it was
adjusted to produce its ordinary low-pitched note, which
was immediately heard. Further out the low boom of
the cannon continued audible after all the other sounds
had ceased.</p>

<p>But it was only during the early part of the day that
this preference for the longer wave was manifested. At
3 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> the case was completely altered, for then the high-pitched
siren was heard when all the other sounds were
inaudible. On many other days we had illustrations of
the varying comparative power of the siren and the gun.
On the 9th of October sometimes the one, sometimes the
other, was predominant. On the morning of the 13th
the siren was clearly heard on Shakespeare’s Cliff, while
two guns with their puffs perfectly visible were unheard.
On October 16th, 2 miles from the signal-station, the gun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
at 11 o’clock was inferior to the siren, but both were
heard. At 12.30, the distance being 6 miles, the gun
was quite unheard, while the siren continued faintly audible.
Later on in the day the experiment was twice repeated.
The puff of the gun was in each case seen, but
nothing was heard. In the last experiment, when the
gun was quenched, the siren sent forth a sound so strong
as to maintain itself through the paddle-noises. The day
was clearly hostile to the passage of the longer sonorous
waves.</p>

<p>October 17th began with a preference for the shorter
waves. At 11.30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> the mastery of the siren over the
gun was pronounced; at 12.30 the gun slightly surpassed
the siren; at 1, 2, and 2.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> the gun also asserted its
mastery. This preference for the longer waves was continued
on October 18th. On October 20th the day began
in favor of the gun, then both became equal, and finally
the siren gained the mastery; but the day had become
stormy, and a storm is always unfavorable to the momentary
gun-sound. The same remark applies to the experiments
of October 21st. At 11 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, distance 6-1/2 miles,
when the siren made itself heard through the noises of
wind, sea, and paddles, the gun was fired; but, though
listened for with all attention, no sound was heard. Half
an hour later the result was the same. On October 24th
five observers saw the flash of the gun at a distance of
5 miles, but heard nothing; all of them at this distance
heard the siren distinctly; a second experiment on the
same day yielded the same result. On the 27th also
the siren was triumphant; and on three distinct occasions
on the 29th its mastery over the gun was very decided.</p>

<p>Such experiments yield new conceptions as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
scattering of sound in the atmosphere. No sound here
employed is a simple sound; in every case the fundamental
note is accompanied by others, and the action of
the atmosphere on these different groups of waves has its
optical analogue in that scattering of the waves of the
luminiferous ether which produces the various shades
and colors of the sky.</p>


<h4>§ 9. <i>Concluding Remarks</i></h4>

<p>A few additional remarks and suggestions will fitly
wind up this chapter. It has been proved that in some
states of the weather the howitzer firing a 3-lb. charge
commands a larger range than the whistles, trumpets, or
siren. This was the case, for example, on the particular
day, October 17th, when the ranges of all the sounds
reached their maximum.</p>

<p>On many other days, however, the inferiority of the
gun to the siren was demonstrated in the clearest manner.
The gun-puffs were seen with the utmost distinctness
at the Foreland, but no sound was heard, the note
of the siren at the same time reaching us with distinct
and considerable power.</p>

<p>The disadvantages of the gun are these:</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The duration of the sound is so short that, unless
the observer is prepared beforehand, the sound, through
lack of attention rather than through its own powerlessness,
is liable to be unheard.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Its liability to be quenched by a local sound is so
great that it is sometimes obliterated by a puff of wind
taking possession of the ears at the time of its arrival.
This point was alluded to by Arago, in his report on the
celebrated experiments of 1822.  By such a puff a mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>mentary
gap is produced in the case of a continuous
sound, but not entire extinction.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Its liability to be quenched or deflected by an
opposing wind, so as to be practically useless at a very
short distance to windward, is very remarkable. A case
has been cited in which the gun failed to be heard
against a violent wind at a distance of 550 yards from
the place of firing, the sound of the siren at the same
time reaching us with great intensity.</p>

<p>Still, notwithstanding these drawbacks, I think the
gun is entitled to rank as a first-class signal. I have
had occasion myself to observe its extreme utility at
Holyhead and the Kish light-vessel near Kingstown.
The commanders of the Holyhead boats, moreover, are
unanimous in their commendation of the gun. An important
addition in its favor is the fact that in a fog
the flash or glare often comes to the aid of the sound.
On this point, the evidence is quite conclusive.</p>

<p>There may be cases in which the combination of the
gun with one of the other signals may be desirable.
Where it is wished to confer an unmistakable individuality
on a fog-signal station, such a combination might
with advantage be resorted to.</p>

<p>If the gun be retained as one form of fog-signal (and I
should be sorry at present to recommend its total abolition),
it ought to be of the most suitable description. Our experiments
prove the sound of the gun to be dependent on
its shape; but we do not know that we have employed
the best shape. This suggests the desirability of constructing
a gun with special reference to the production of sound.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span></p>
<p>An absolutely uniform superiority on all days cannot
be conceded to any one of the instruments subjected to
examination; still, our observations have been so numerous
and long-continued as to enable us to come to the
sure conclusion, that, on the whole, the steam-siren is
the most powerful fog-signal which has hitherto been
tried in England. It is specially powerful when local
noises, such as those of wind, rigging, breaking waves,
shore-surf, and the rattle of pebbles, have to be overcome.
Its density, quality, pitch, and penetration, render
it dominant over such noises after all other signal-sounds
have succumbed.</p>

<p>I have not, therefore, hesitated to recommend the
introduction of the siren as a coast-signal.</p>

<p>It will be desirable in each case to confer upon the
instrument a power of rotation, so as to enable the person
in charge of it to point its trumpet against the wind
or in any other required direction. This arrangement
was made at the South Foreland, and it presents no
mechanical difficulty. It is also desirable to mount the
siren, so as to permit of the depression of its trumpet
fifteen or twenty degrees below the horizon.</p>

<p>In selecting the position at which a fog-signal is to
be mounted, the possible influence of a sound-shadow,
and the possible extinction of the sound by the interference
of the direct waves with waves reflected from the
shore, must form the subject of the gravest consideration.
Preliminary trials may, in most cases, be necessary before
fixing on the precise point at which the instrument is to
be placed.</p>

<p>The siren which has been long known to scientific
men is worked with air; and it would be worth while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
to try how the fog-siren would behave supposing compressed
air to be substituted for steam. Compressed air
might also be tried with the whistles.</p>

<p>No fog-signal hitherto tried is able to fulfil the condition
laid down in a very able letter already referred
to, namely, “<em>that all fog-signals should be distinctly audible
for at least 4 miles, under every circumstance</em>.” Circumstances
may exist to prevent the most powerful sound
from being heard at half this distance. What may with
certainty be affirmed is, that in almost all cases the siren
may certainly be relied on at a distance of 2 miles; in
the great majority of cases it may be relied upon at a
distance of 3 miles, and in the majority of cases to a distance
greater than 3 miles.</p>

<p>Happily the experiments thus far made are perfectly
concurrent in indicating that at the particular time when
fog-signals are needed, the air holding the fog in suspension
is in a highly-homogeneous condition; hence it is in
the highest degree probable that in the case of fog we
may rely upon the signals being effective at far greater
distances than those just mentioned.</p>

<p>I am cautious not to inspire the mariner with a confidence
which may prove delusive. When he hears a
fog-signal he ought, as a general rule (at all events until
extended experience justifies the contrary), to assume the
source of sound to be not more than 2 or 3 miles distant,
and to heave his lead or to take other necessary
precautions. If he errs at all in his estimate of distance,
it ought to be on the side of safety.</p>

<p>With the instruments now at our disposal wisely established
along our coasts, I venture to think that the
saving of property in ten years will be an exceedingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
large multiple of the outlay necessary for the establishment
of such signals. The saving of life appeals to the
higher motives of humanity.</p>

<p>In a report written for the Trinity House on the subject
of fog-signals, my excellent predecessor, Prof. Faraday,
expresses the opinion that a false promise to the
mariner would be worse than no promise at all. Casting
our eyes back upon the observations here recorded, we
find the sound-range on clear, calm days varying from
2-1/2 miles to 16-1/2 miles. It must be evident that an instruction
founded on the latter observation would be
fraught with peril in weather corresponding to the
former. Not the maximum but the minimum sound-range
should be impressed upon the mariner. Want of
attention to this point may be followed by disastrous
consequences.</p>

<p>This remark is not made without cause. I have before
me a “Notice to Mariners” regarding a fog-whistle
recently mounted at Cape Race, which is reputed to have
a range of 20 miles in calm weather, 30 miles with the
wind, and in stormy weather or against the wind 7 to 10
miles. Now, considering the distance reached by sound
in our observations, I should be willing to concede the
possibility, in a more homogeneous atmosphere than ours,
of a sound-range on <em>some</em> calm days of 20 miles, and on
<em>some</em> light windy days of 30 miles, to a powerful whistle;
but I entertain a strong belief that the stating of these
distances, or of the distance 7 to 10 miles against a
storm, without any qualification, is calculated to inspire
the mariner with false confidence. I would venture to
affirm that at Cape Race calm days might be found in
which the range of the sound will be less than one-fourth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
of what this notice states it to be. Such publications
ought to be without a trace of exaggeration,
and furnish only data on which the mariner may with
perfect confidence rely. My object in extending these
observations over so long a period was to make evident
to all how fallacious it would be, and how mischievous it
might be, to draw general conclusions from observations
made in weather of great acoustic transparency.</p>

<p>Thus ends, for the present at all events, an inquiry
which I trust will prove of some importance, scientific as
well as practical. In conducting it I have had to congratulate
myself on the unfailing aid and co-operation of
the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House. Captain Drew,
Captain Close, Captain Were, Captain Atkins, and the
Deputy Master, have all from time to time taken part
in the inquiry. To the eminent arctic navigator, Admiral
Collinson, who showed throughout unflagging and, I
would add, philosophic interest in the investigation, I am
indebted for most important practical aid. He was almost
always at my side, comparing opinions with me, placing
the steamer in the required positions, and making with
consummate skill and promptness the necessary sextant
observations. I am also deeply sensible of the important
services rendered by Mr. Douglass, the able and indefatigable
engineer, by Mr. Ayres, the assistant engineer, and
by Mr. Price Edwards, the private secretary of the Deputy
Master of the Trinity House.</p>

<p>The officers and gunners at the South Foreland also
merit my best thanks, as also Mr. Holmes and Mr. Laidlaw,
who had charge of the trumpets, whistles, and
siren.</p>

<p>In the subsequent experimental treatment of the sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>ject
I have been most ably aided by my excellent assistant,
Mr. John Cottrell.</p>

<h3>SUMMARY OF CHAPTER VII</h3>

<p>The paper of Dr. Derham, published in the “Philosophical
Transactions” for 1708, has been hitherto the
almost exclusive source of our knowledge of the causes
which affect the transmission of sound through the
atmosphere.</p>

<p>Derham found that fog obstructed sound, that rain
and hail obstructed sound, but that above all things falling
snow, or a coating of fresh snow upon the ground,
tended to check the propagation of sound through the
atmosphere.</p>

<p>With a view to the protection of life and property at
sea in the years 1873 and 1874, this subject received an
exhaustive examination, observational and experimental.
The investigation was conducted at the expense of the
Government and under the auspices of the Elder Brethren
of the Trinity House.</p>

<p>The most conflicting results were at first obtained.
On the 19th of May, 1873, the sound range was 3-1/3 miles;
on the 20th it was 5-1/2 miles; on the 2d of June, 6 miles;
on the 3d, more than 9 miles; on the 10th, 9 miles; on
the 25th, 6 miles; on the 26th, 9-1/4 miles; on the 1st of
July, 12-3/4 miles; on the 2d, 4 miles; while on the 3d,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
with a clear calm atmosphere and smooth sea, it was less
than 3 miles.</p>

<p>These discrepancies were proved to be due to a state
of the air which bears the same relation to sound that
cloudiness does to light. By streams of air differently
heated, or saturated in different degrees with aqueous
vapors, the atmosphere is rendered <em>flocculent</em> to sound.</p>

<p><i>Acoustic clouds</i>, in fact, are incessantly floating or
flying through the air. They have nothing whatever to
do with ordinary clouds, fogs, or haze. The most transparent
atmosphere may be filled with them; converting
days of extraordinary optical transparency into days of
equally extraordinary acoustic opacity.</p>

<p>The connection hitherto supposed to exist between a
clear atmosphere and the transmission of sound is therefore
dissolved.</p>

<p>The intercepted sound is wasted by repeated reflections
in the acoustic cloud, as light is wasted by repeated reflections
in an ordinary cloud. And as from the ordinary
cloud the light reflected reaches the eye, so from the
perfectly invisible acoustic cloud the reflected sound
reaches the ear.</p>

<p>Aërial echoes of extraordinary intensity and of long
duration are thus produced. They occur, contrary to the
opinion hitherto entertained, in the clearest air.</p>

<p>It is to the wafting of such acoustic clouds through
the atmosphere that the fluctuations in the sounds of our
public clocks and of church-bells are due.</p>

<p>The existence of these aërial echoes has been proved
both by observation and experiment. They may arise
either from air-currents differently heated, or from air-currents
differently saturated with vapor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span></p>

<p>Rain has no sensible power to obstruct sound.</p>

<p>Hail has no sensible power to obstruct sound.</p>

<p>Snow has no sensible power to obstruct sound.</p>

<p>Fog has no sensible power to obstruct sound.</p>

<p>The air associated with fog is, as a general rule,
highly homogeneous and favorable to the transmission
of sound.  The notions hitherto entertained regarding the
action of fog are untenable.</p>

<p>Experiments on artificial showers of rain, hail, and
snow, and on artificial fogs of extraordinary density, confirm
the results of observation.</p>

<p>As long as the air forms a continuous medium the
amount of sound scattered by small bodies suspended in
it is astonishingly small.</p>

<p>This is illustrated by the ease with which sound traverses
layers of calico, cambric, silk, flannel, baize, and
felt. It freely passes through all these substances in
thicknesses sufficient to intercept the light of the sun.</p>

<p>Through six layers of thin silk, for example, it passes
with little obstruction; it finds its way through a layer of
close felt half an inch thick, and it is not wholly intercepted
by 200 layers of cotton-net.</p>

<p>The atmosphere exercises a selective choice upon the
waves of sound which varies from day to day, and even
from hour to hour. It is sometimes favorable to the
transmission of the longer, and at other times favorable
to the transmission of the shorter, sonorous waves.</p>

<p>The recognized action of the wind has been confirmed
by this investigation.</p>

<h3>§ 1. <i>Interference of Water-Waves</i></h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>ROM a boat in Cowes Harbor, in moderate weather,
I have often watched the masts and ropes of the
ships, as mirrored in the water. The images of
the ropes revealed the condition of the surface, indicating
by long and wide protuberances the passage of the larger
rollers, and, by smaller indentations, the ripples which
crept like parasites over the sides of the larger waves.
The sea was able to accommodate itself to the requirements
of all its undulations, great and small. When the
surface was touched with an oar, or when drops were
permitted to fall from the oar into the water, there was
also room for the tiny wavelets thus generated. This
carving of the surface by waves and ripples had its limit
only in my powers of observation; every wave and every
ripple asserted its right of place, and retained its individual
existence, amid the crowd of other motions which
agitated the water.</p>

<p>The law that rules this chasing of the sea, this crossing
and intermingling of innumerable small waves, is <em>that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
the resultant motion of every particle of water is the sum
of the individual motions imparted to it</em>. If a particle be
acted on at the same moment by two impulses, both of
which tend to raise it, it will be lifted by a force equal
to the sum of both. If acted upon by two impulses, one
of which tends to raise it, and the other to depress it, it
will be acted upon by a force equal to the difference of
both. When, therefore, the sum of the motions is spoken
of, the <em>algebraic sum</em> is meant—the motions which tend
to raise the particle being regarded as positive, and those
which tend to depress it as negative.</p>

<p>When two stones are cast into smooth water, 20 or 30
feet apart, round each stone is formed a series of expanding
circular waves, every one of which consists of a ridge
and a furrow. The waves touch, cross each other, and
carve the surface into little eminences and depressions.
Where ridge coincides with ridge, we have the water
raised to a double height; where furrow coincides with
furrow, we have it depressed to a double depth; where
ridge coincides with furrow, we have the water reduced
to its average level. The resultant motion of the water
at every point is, as above stated, the algebraic sum of
the motions impressed upon that point. And if, instead
of two sources of disturbance, we had ten, or a hundred,
or a thousand, the consequence would be the same; the
actual result might transcend our powers of observation,
but the law above enunciated would still hold good.</p>

<p>Instead of the intersection of waves from two distinct
centres of disturbance, we may cause direct and reflected
waves, from the same centre, to cross each other. Many
of you know the beauty of the effects produced when
light is reflected from ripples of water. When mercury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
is employed the effect is more brilliant still. Here, by a
proper mode of agitation, direct and reflected waves may
be caused to cross and interlace, and by the most wonderful
self-analysis to untie their knotted scrolls. The adjacent
figure (Fig. 149), which is copied from the excellent
“Wellenlehre” of the brothers Weber, will give
some idea of the beauty of these effects. It represents
the chasing produced by the intersection of direct and
reflected water-waves in a circular vessel, the point of
disturbance (marked by the smallest circle in the figure)
being midway between the centre and the circumference.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 149.</span></div>
</div>

<p>This power of water to accept and transmit multitudinous
impulses is shared by air, which concedes the right
of space and motion to any number of sonorous waves.
The same air is competent to accept and transmit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
vibrations of a thousand instruments at the same time.
When we try to visualize the motion of that air—to
present to the eye of the mind the battling of the pulses
direct and reverberated—the imagination retires baffled
from the attempt. Still, amid all the complexity, the
law above enunciated holds good, every particle of air
being animated by a resultant motion, which is the algebraic
sum of all the individual motions imparted to it.
And the most wonderful thing of all is, that the human
ear, though acted on only by a cylinder of that air,
which does not exceed the thickness of a quill, can
detect the components of the motion, and, by an act of
attention, can even isolate from the aërial entanglement
any particular sound.</p>


<h3>§ 2. <i>Interference of Sound</i></h3>

<p>When two unisonant tuning-forks are sounded together,
it is easy to see that the forks may so vibrate
that the condensations of the one shall coincide with the
condensations of the other, and the rarefactions of the one
with the rarefactions of the other. If this be the case,
the two forks will assist each other. The condensations
will, in fact, become more condensed, the rarefactions
more rarefied; and as it is upon the difference of density
between the condensations and rarefactions that <em>loudness</em>
depends, the two vibrating forks, thus supporting each
other, will produce a sound of greater intensity than that
of either of them vibrating alone.</p>

<p>It is, however, also easy to see that the two forks may
be so related to each other that one of them shall require
a condensation at the place where the other requires a
rarefaction; that the one fork shall urge the air-particles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
forward, while the other urges them backward. If the
opposing forces be equal, particles so solicited will move
neither backward nor forward, the aërial rest which corresponds
to silence being the result. Thus it is possible,
by adding the sound of one fork to that of another, to
abolish the sounds of both. We have here a phenomenon
which, above all others, characterizes wave-motion.
It was this phenomenon, as manifested in optics, that led
to the undulatory theory of light, the most cogent proof
of that theory being based upon the fact that, by adding
light to light, we may produce darkness, just as we can
produce silence by adding sound to sound.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_381.jpg" width="400" height="109" alt="Fig. 150." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 150.</span></div>
</div>

<p>During the vibration of a tuning-fork the distance between
the two prongs is alternately increased and diminished.
Let us call the motion which increases the distance
the <em>outward swing</em>, and that which diminishes the
distance the <em>inward swing</em> of the fork. And let us suppose
that our two forks, <span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span>, Fig. 150, reach the
limits of their outward swing and their inward swing at
the same moment. In this case the <em>phases</em> of their motion,
to use the technical term, are the same. For the
sake of simplicity we will confine our attention to the
right-hand prongs, <span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span>, of the two forks, neglecting
the other two prongs; and now let us ask what must
be the distance between the prongs <span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span>, when the
condensations and rarefactions of both, indicated respec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>tively
by the dark and light shading, coincide? A little
reflection will make it clear that if the distance from <span class="smcap">B</span>
to <span class="smcap">A</span> be equal to the length of a whole sonorous wave,
coincidence between the two systems of waves must follow.
The same would evidently occur were the distance
between <span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span> two wave-lengths, three wave-lengths,
four wave-lengths—in short, any number of whole wavelengths.
In all such cases we shall have coincidence of
the two systems of waves, and consequently a reinforcement
of the sound of the one fork by that of the other.
Both the condensations and rarefactions between <span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">C</span>
are, in this case, more pronounced than they would be if
either of the forks were suppressed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_382.jpg" width="400" height="92" alt="Fig. 151." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 151.</span></div>
</div>

<p>But if the prong <span class="smcap">B</span> be only half the length of a wave
behind <span class="smcap">A</span>, what must occur? Manifestly the rarefactions
of one of the systems of waves will then coincide with
the condensations of the other system, the air to the
right of <span class="smcap">A</span> being reduced to quiescence. This is shown
in Fig. 151, where the uniformity of shading indicates
an absence both of condensations and rarefactions. When
<span class="smcap">B</span> is two half wave-lengths behind <span class="smcap">A</span>, the waves, as already
explained, support each other; when they are three
half wave-lengths apart, they destroy each other. Or
expressed generally, we have augmentation or destruction
according as the distance between the two prongs
amounts to an even or an odd number of semi-undula<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>tions.
Precisely the same is true of the waves of light.
If through any cause one system of ethereal waves be
any <em>even</em> number of semi-undulations behind another system,
the two systems support each other when they coalesce,
and we have more light. If the one system be
any <em>odd</em> number of semi-undulations behind the other,
they oppose each other, and a destruction of light is the
result of their coalescence.</p>

<p>The action here referred to, both as regards sound and
light is called <em>Interference</em>.</p>


<h3>§ 3. <i>Experimental Illustrations</i></h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_383.jpg" width="400" height="163" alt="Fig. 152." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 152.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Sir John Herschel was the first to propose to divide a
stream of sound into two branches, of different lengths,
causing the branches afterward to reunite, and interfere
with each other. This idea has been recently followed
out with success by M. Quincke; and it has been still
further improved upon by M. König. The principle of
these experiments will be at once evident from Fig. 152.
The tube <i>o f</i> divides into two branches at <i>f</i>, the one
branch being carried round <i>n</i>, and the other round <i>m</i>.
The two branches are caused to reunite at <i>g</i>, and to end
in a common canal, <i>g p</i>. The portion <i>b n</i> of the tube<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
which slides over <i>a b</i> can be drawn out as shown in the
figure, and thus the sound-waves can be caused to pass
over different distances in the two branches. Placing a
vibrating tuning-fork at <i>o</i>, and the ear at <i>p</i>, when the
two branches are of the same length, the waves through
both reach the ear together, and the sound of the fork is
heard. Drawing <i>n b</i> out, a point is at length obtained
where the sound of the fork is extinguished. This occurs
when the distance <i>a b</i> is one-fourth of a wave-length; or,
in other words, when the whole right-hand branch is half
a wave-length longer than the left-hand one. Drawing
<i>b n</i> still further out, the sound is again heard; and when
twice the distance <i>a b</i> amounts to a whole wave-length,
it reaches a maximum. Thus, according as the difference
of both branches amounts to half a wave-length, or to a
whole wave-length, we have reinforcement or destruction
of the two series of sonorous waves. In practice, the
tube <i>o f</i> ought to be prolonged until the direct sound of
the fork is unheard, the attention of the ear being then
wholly concentrated on the sounds that reach it through
the tube.</p>

<p>It is quite plain that the wave-length of any simple
tone may be readily found by this instrument. It is only
necessary to ascertain the difference of path which produces
complete interference. Twice this difference is the
wave-length; and if the rate of vibration be at the same
time known, we can immediately calculate the velocity of
sound in air.</p>

<p>Each of the two forks now before you executes
exactly 256 vibrations in a second. Sounded together,
they are in unison. Loading one of them with a bit of
wax, it vibrates a little more slowly than its neighbor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
The wax, say, reduces the number of vibrations to 255 in
a second; how must their waves affect each other? If
they start at the same moment, condensation coinciding
with condensation, and rarefaction with rarefaction, it is
quite manifest that this state of things cannot continue.
At the 128th vibration their phases are in complete opposition,
one of them having gained half a vibration on the
other. Here the one fork generates a condensation where
the other generates a rarefaction; and the consequence is,
that the two forks, at this particular point, completely
neutralize each other. From this point onward, however,
the forks support each other more and more, until, at the
end of a second, when the one has completed its 255th,
and the other its 256th vibration, condensation again
coincides with condensation, and rarefaction with rarefaction,
the full effect of both sounds being produced upon
the ear.</p>

<p>It is quite manifest that under these circumstances we
cannot have the continuous flow of perfect unison. We
have, on the contrary, alternate reinforcements and diminutions
of the sound. We obtain, in fact, the effect
known to musicians by the name of <em>beats</em>, which, as
here explained, are a result of interference.</p>

<p>I now load this fork still more heavily, by attaching
a fourpenny-piece to the wax; the coincidences and interferences
follow each other more rapidly than before; we
have a quicker succession of beats. In our last experiment,
the one fork accomplished one vibration more than
the other in a second, and we had a single beat in the
same time. In the present case, one fork vibrates 250
times, while the other vibrates 256 times in a second, and
the number of beats per second is 6. A little reflection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
will make it plain that in the interval required by the
one fork to execute one vibration more than the other,
a beat must occur; and inasmuch as, in the case now
before us, there are six such intervals in a second, there
must be six beats in the same
time. In short, <em>the number of
beats per second is always equal
to the difference between the two
rates of vibration</em>.</p>


<h3>§ 4. <i>Interference of Waves
from Organ-pipes</i></h3>

<div class="figleft250">
<img src="images/i_386.jpg" width="250" height="413" alt="Fig. 153." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 153.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Beats may be produced by
all sonorous bodies. These
two tall organ-pipes, for example,
when sounded together,
give powerful beats, one of
them being slightly longer
than the other. Here are two
other pipes, which are now in
perfect unison, being exactly
of the same length. But it is only necessary to bring
the finger near the embouchure of one of the pipes, Fig.
153, to lower its rate of vibration, and produce loud and
rapid beats. The placing of the hand over the open top
of one of the pipes also lowers its rate of vibration, and
produces beats, which follow each other with augmented
rapidity as the top of the pipe is closed more and more.
By a stronger blast the first two harmonics of the pipes
are brought out. These higher notes also interfere, and
you have these quicker beats.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_387.jpg" width="350" height="418" alt="Fig. 154." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 154.</span></div>
</div>

<p>No more beautiful illustration of this phenomenon can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
be adduced than that furnished by two sounding-flames.
Two such flames are now before you, the tube surrounding
one of them being provided with a telescopic slider,
Fig. 154. There are, at present, no beats, because the
tubes are not sufficiently near unison. I gradually
lengthen the shorter tube by raising its slider. Rapid
beats are now heard; now they are slower; now slower
still; and now both flames sing together in perfect
unison. Continuing the upward motion of the slider, I
make the tube too long; the beats begin again, and
quicken, until finally their sequence is so rapid as to
appeal only as roughness to the ear. The flames, you
observe, dance within their tubes in time to the beats.
As already stated, these beats cause a silent flame within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
a tube to quiver when the voice is thrown to a proper
pitch, and when the position of the flame is rightly
chosen, the beats set it singing. With the flames of large
rose-burners, and with tin tubes from 3 to 9 feet long, we
obtain beats of exceeding power.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_388.jpg" width="400" height="366" alt="Fig. 155." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 155.</span></div>
</div>

<p>You have just heard the beats produced by two tall
organ-pipes nearly in unison with each other. Two other
pipes are now mounted on our wind-chest, Fig. 155, each
of which, however, is provided at its centre with a membrane
intended to act upon a flame.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> Two small tubes
lead from the spaces closed by the membranes, and unite
afterward, the membranes of both the organ-pipes being
thus connected with the same flame. By means of the
sliders, <i>s s′</i>, near the summits of the pipes, they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
either brought into unison or thrown out of it at pleasure.
They are not at present in unison, and the beats
they produce follow each other with great rapidity. The
flame connected with the central membranes dances in
time to the beats. When brought nearer to unison, the
beats are slower, and the flame at successive intervals
withdraws its light and appears to exhale it. A process
which reminds you of the inspiration and expiration of the
breath is thus carried on by the flame. If the mirror,
<span class="smcap">M</span>, be now turned, the flame produces a luminous band—continuous
at certain places, but for the most part broken
into distinct images of the flame. The continuous parts
correspond to the intervals of interference where the two
sets of vibrations abolish each other.</p>

<p>Instead of permitting both pipes to act upon the same
flame, we may associate a flame with each of them. The
deportment of the flames is then very instructive. Imagine
both flames to be in the same vertical line, the one
of them being exactly under the other. Bringing the
pipes into unison, and turning the mirror, we resolve
each flame into a chain of images, but we notice that the
images of the one occupy the spaces <em>between</em> the images
of the other. The periods of extinction of the one flame,
therefore, correspond to the periods of kindling of the
other. The experiment proves that, when two unisonant
pipes are placed thus close to each other, their vibrations
are in opposite phases. The consequence of this is, that
the two sets of vibrations permanently neutralize each
other, so that at a little distance from the pipes you fail
to hear the fundamental tone of either. For this reason
we cannot, with any advantage, place close to each other
in an organ several pipes of the same pitch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span></p>

<h3>§ 5. <i>Lissajous’s Illustration of Beats of Two Tuning-forks</i></h3>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="f156" id="f156">
<img src="images/i_390.jpg" width="500" height="288" alt="Fig. 156." /></a>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 156.</span></div>
</div>

<p>In the case of beats, the amplitude of the oscillating
air reaches a maximum and a minimum periodically. By
the beautiful method of M. Lissajous we can illustrate
optically this alternate augmentation and diminution of
amplitude. Placing a large tuning-fork, <span class="smcap">T′</span>, Fig. 156, in
front of the lamp <span class="smcap">L</span>, a luminous beam is received upon
the mirror attached to the fork. This is reflected back
to the mirror of a second fork, <span class="smcap">T</span>, and by it thrown on to
the screen, where it forms a luminous disk. When the
bow is drawn over the fork <span class="smcap">T′</span>, the beam, as in the experiments
described in the second chapter, is tilted up
and down, the disk upon the screen stretching to a luminous
band three feet long. If, in drawing the bow over
this second fork, the vibrations of both coincide in phase,
the band will be lengthened; if the phases are in opposition,
total or partial neutralization of the one fork by the
other will be the result. It so happens that in the present
instance the second fork adds something to the action<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
of the first, the band of light being now four feet long.
These forks have been tuned as perfectly as possible.
Each of them executes exactly 64 vibrations in a second;
the initial relation of their phases remains, therefore, constant,
and hence you notice a gradual shortening of the
luminous band, like that observed during the subsidence
of the vibrations of a single fork. The band at length
dwindles to the original disk, which remains motionless
upon the screen.</p>

<p>By attaching, with wax, a threepenny-piece to the
prong of one of these forks, its rate of vibration is
lowered. The phases of the two forks cannot now retain
a constant relation to each other. One fork incessantly
gains upon the other, and the consequence is that sometimes
the phases of both coincide, and at other times
they are in opposition. Observe the result. At the present
moment the two forks conspire, and we have a luminous
band four feet long upon the screen. This slowly
contracts, drawing itself up to a mere disk; but the
action halts here only during the moment of opposition.
That passed, the forks begin again to assist each other,
and the disk once more slowly stretches into a band.
The action here is very slow; but it may be quickened
by attaching a sixpence to the loaded fork. The band
of light now stretches and contracts in perfect rhythm.
The action, rendered thus optically evident, is impressed
upon the air of this room; its particles alternately vibrate
and come to rest, and, as a consequence, beats are heard
in synchronism with the changes of the figure upon the
screen.</p>

<p>The time which elapses from maximum to maximum,
or from minimum to minimum, is that required for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
one fork to perform one vibration more than the other.
At present this time is about two seconds. In two seconds,
therefore, one beat occurs. When we augment the
dissonance by increasing the load, the rhythmic lengthening
and shortening of the band is more rapid, while
the intermittent hum of the forks is more audible. There
are now six elongations and shortenings in the interval
taken up a moment ago by one; the beats at the same
time being heard at the rate of three a second. By loading
the forks still more, the alternations may be caused to
succeed each other so rapidly that they can no longer be
followed by the eye, while the beats, at the same time,
cease to be individually distinct, and appeal as a kind of
roughness to the ear.</p>

<p>In the experiments with a single tuning-fork, already
described (<a href="#f22">Fig. 22</a>, Chapter II.), the beam reflected from
the fork was received on a looking-glass, and, by turning
the glass, the band of light on the screen was caused to
stretch out into a long wavy line. It was explained at
the time that the loudness of the sound depended on the
depth of the indentations. Hence, if the band of light of
varying length now before us on the screen be drawn out
in a sinuous line, the indentations ought to be at some
places deep, while at others they ought to vanish altogether.
This is the case. By a little tact the mirror of
the fork <span class="smcap">T</span> (<a href="#f156">Fig. 156</a>) is caused to turn through a small
angle, a sinuous line composed of swellings and contractions
(Fig. 157) being drawn upon the screen. The swell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>ings
correspond to the periods of sound, and the contractions
to those of silence.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></p>

<p>Two vibrating bodies, then, each of which separately
produces a musical sound, can, when acting together,
neutralize each other. Hence, by quenching the vibrations
of one of them, we may give sonorous effect to
the other. It often happens, for instance, that when two
tuning-forks, on their resonant cases, are vibrating in
unison, the stoppage of one of them is accompanied
by an augmentation of the sound. This point may be
further illustrated by the vibrating bell, already described
(<a href="#f78">Fig. 78</a>, Chapter IV.) Placing its resonant tube in front
of one of its nodes, a sound is heard, but nothing like
what is heard when the tube is opposed to a ventral segment.
The reason of this is that the vibrations of a bell
on the opposite sides of a nodal line are in opposite
directions, and they therefore interfere with each other.
By introducing a glass plate between the bell and the
tube, the vibrations on one side of the nodal line may
be intercepted; an instant augmentation of the sound is
the consequence.</p>


<h3>§ 6. <i>Interference of Waves from a Vibrating Disk.
Hopkins’s and Lissajous’s Illustrations</i></h3>

<p>In a vibrating disk every two adjacent sectors move
at the same time in opposite directions. When the one
sector rises the other falls, the nodal line marking the
limit between them. Hence, at the moment when any
sector produces a condensation in the air above it, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>adjacent sector produces a rarefaction in the same air.
A partial destruction of the sound of one sector by the
other is the result. You will now understand the instrument
by which the late William Hopkins illustrated the
principle of interference. The tube <span class="smcap">A B</span>, Fig. 158, divides
at <span class="smcap">B</span> into two branches. The end <span class="smcap">A</span> of the tube is
closed by a membrane. Scattering sand upon this membrane,
and holding the ends of the branches over <em>adjacent</em>
sectors of a vibrating disk, no motion (or, at least, an
extremely feeble motion) of the sand is perceived. Placing
the ends of the two branches over <em>alternate</em> sectors of
the disk, the sand is tossed from the membrane, proving
that in this case we have coincidence of vibration on the
part of the two sectors.</p>

<p>We are now prepared for a very instructive experiment,
which we owe to M. Lissajous. Drawing a bow
over the edge of a brass disk, I divide it into six vibrating
sectors. When the palm of the hand is brought over
any one of them, the sound, instead of being diminished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
is augmented. When two hands are placed over two <em>adjacent</em>
sectors, you notice no increase of the sound; but
when they are placed over <em>alternate</em> sectors, as in Fig.
159, a striking augmentation of the sound is the consequence.
By simply lowering and raising the hands,
marked variations of intensity are produced. By the
approach of the hands the vibrations of the two sectors
are intercepted; their interference right and left
being thus abolished, the remaining sectors sound more
loudly. Passing the single hand to and fro along the
surface, you also hear a rise and fall of the sound. It
rises when the hand is over a vibrating sector; it falls
when the hand is over a nodal line. Thus, by sacrificing
a portion of the vibrations, we make the residue more
effectual. Experiments similar to these may be made
with light and radiant heat. If of two beams of the
former, which destroy each other by interference, one
be removed, light takes the place of darkness; and if
of two interfering beams of the latter one be intercepted,
heat takes the place of cold.</p>


<h3>§ 7. <i>Quenching the Sound of one Prong of a Tuning-fork
by that of the other</i></h3>

<p>You have remarked the almost total absence of sound
on the part of a vibrating tuning-fork when held free in
the hand. The feebleness of the fork as a sounding
body arises in part from interference. The prongs always
vibrate in opposite directions, one producing a condensation
where the other produces a rarefaction, a destruction
of sound being the consequence. By simply
passing a pasteboard tube over one of the prongs of the
fork, its vibrations are in part intercepted, and an aug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>mentation
of the sound is the result. The single prong
is thus proved to be more effectual than the two prongs.
<span class="figleft250">
<img src="images/i_396.jpg" width="250" height="237" alt="Fig. 160." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 160.</span></span>
</span>
There are positions in
which the destruction
of the sound of one
prong by that of the
other is <em>total</em>. These
positions are easily
found by striking the
fork and turning it
round before the ear.
When the back of the
prong is parallel to
the ear, the sound is
heard; when the side
surfaces of both prongs are parallel to the ear, the sound
is also heard; but when the <em>corner</em> of a prong is carefully
presented to the ear, the sound is utterly destroyed.
During one complete rotation of the fork we find four
positions where the sound is thus obliterated.</p>



<p>Let <i>s s</i> (Fig. 160) represent the two ends of the tuning-fork,
looked down upon as it stands upright. When
the ear is placed at <i>a</i> or <i>b</i>, or at <i>c</i> or <i>d</i>, the sound is
heard. Along the four dotted lines, on the contrary, the
waves generated by the two prongs completely neutralize
each other, and nothing is there heard. These lines have
been proved by Weber to be hyperbolic curves; and this
must be their character according to the principle of
interference.</p>

<p>This remarkable case of interference, which was first
noticed by Dr. Thomas Young, and thoroughly investigated
by the brothers Weber, may be rendered audible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
by means of resonance. Bringing a vibrating fork over
a jar which resounds to it, and causing the fork to rotate
slowly, in four positions we have a loud resonance; in
<span class="figright250">
<img src="images/i_397.jpg" width="250" height="222" alt="Fig. 161." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 161.</span></span>
</span>
four others absolute
silence, alternate risings
and fallings of the sound
accompanying the fork’s
rotation. While the fork
is over the jar with its
corner downward and
the sound entirely extinguished,
let a pasteboard
tube be passed
over one of its prongs,
as in Fig. 161, a loud
resonance announces the withdrawal of the vibrations of
that prong. To obtain this effect, the fork must be held
over the centre of the jar, so that the air shall be symmetrically
distributed on both sides of it. Moving the fork
from the centre toward one of the sides, without altering
its inclination in the least, we obtain a forcible sound.
Interference, however, is also possible near the side of
the jar. Holding the fork, not with its corner downward,
but with both its prongs in the same horizontal plane, a
position is soon found near the side of the jar where the
sound is extinguished. In passing completely from side
to side over the mouth of the jar, two such places of
interference are discoverable.</p>



<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_398.jpg" width="300" height="211" alt="Fig. 162." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 162.</span></div>
</div>

<p>A variety of experiments will suggest themselves to
the reflecting mind, by which the effect of interference
may be illustrated. It is easy, for example, to find a jar
which resounds to a vibrating plate. Such a jar, placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
over a vibrating segment of the plate, produces a powerful
resonance. Placed over a nodal line, the resonance is
entirely absent; but if a piece of pasteboard be interposed
between the jar and plate, so as to cut off the vibrations
on one side of the nodal line, the jar instantly resounds
to the vibrations of the other. Again, holding two forks,
which vibrate with the same rapidity, over two resonant
jars, the sound of both flows forth in unison. When a
bit of wax is attached to one of the forks, powerful beats
are heard. Removing the wax, the unison is restored.
When one of these unisonant forks is placed in the flame
of a spirit-lamp its elasticity is changed, and it produces
long loud beats with its unwarmed fellow.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> If while one
of the forks is sounding on its resonant case the other
be excited and brought near the mouth of the case, as
in Fig. 162, loud beats declare the absence of unison.
Dividing a jar by a vertical diaphragm, and bringing one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>of the forks over one of its halves, and the other fork
over the other; the two semi-cylinders of air produce
beats by their interference. But the diaphragm is not
necessary; on removing it, the beats continue as before,
one-half of the same column of air interfering with the
other.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></p>

<p>The intermittent sound of certain bells, heard more
especially when their tones are subsiding, is an effect
of interference. The bell, through lack of symmetry, as
explained in the fourth chapter, vibrates in one direction
a little more rapidly than in the other, and beats are the
consequence of the coalescence of the two different rates
of vibration.</p>


<h3>RESULTANT TONES</h3>

<p>We have now to turn from this question of interference
to the consideration of a new class of musical
sounds, of which the beats were long considered to be
the progenitors. The sounds here referred to require for
their production the union of two distinct musical tones.
Where such union is effected, under the proper conditions,
<em>resultant tones</em> are generated, which are quite distinct
from the primaries concerned in their production.
They were discovered, in 1745, by a German organist
named Sorge, but the publication of the fact attracted
little attention. They were discovered independently, in
1754, by the celebrated Italian violinist Tartini, and after
him have been called Tartini’s tones.</p>

<p>To produce them it is desirable, if not necessary, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>have the two primary tones of considerable intensity.
Helmholtz prefers the siren to all other means of exciting
them, and with this instrument they are very readily
obtained. It requires some attention at first, on the part
of the listener, to single out the resultant tone from the
general mass of sound; but, with a little practice, this is
readily accomplished; and though the unpracticed ear
may fail, in the first instance, thus to analyze the sound,
the clang-tint is influenced in an unmistakable manner by
the admixture of resultant tones. I set Dove’s siren in
rotation, and open two series of holes at the same time;
with the utmost strain of attention, I am as yet unable
to hear the least symptom of a resultant tone. Urging
the instrument to greater rapidity, a dull, low droning
mingles with the two primary sounds. Raising the speed
of rotation, the low, resultant tone rises rapidly in pitch,
and now, to those who stand close to the instrument, it
is very audible. The two series of holes here open
number 8 and 12 respectively. The resultant tone is in
this case an octave below the deepest of the two primaries.
Opening two other series of orifices, numbering 12
and 16 respectively, the resultant tone is quite audible.
Its rate of vibration is one-third of the rate of the deepest
of the two primaries. In all cases, <em>the resultant tone
is that which corresponds to a rate of vibration equal to the
difference of the rates of the two primaries</em>.</p>

<p>The resultant tone here spoken of is that actually
heard in the experiment. But with finer methods of experiment
other resultant tones are proved to exist. Those
on which we have now fixed our attention are, however,
the most important. They are called <em>difference-tones</em> by
Helmholtz, in consequence of the law just mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span></p>

<p>To bring these resultant tones audibly forth, the primaries
must, as already stated, be forcible. When they
are feeble the resultants are unheard. I am acquainted
with no method of exciting these tones more simple and
effectual than a pair of suitable singing-flames. Two such
flames may be caused to emit powerful notes—self-created,
self-sustained, and requiring no muscular effort on the
part of the observer to keep them going. Here are two
of them. The length of the shorter of the two tubes surrounding
these flames is 10-3/8 inches, that of the other is
11·4 inches. I hearken to the sound, and in the midst
of the shrillness detect a very deep resultant tone. The
reason of its depth is manifest: the two tubes being so
nearly alike in length, the difference between their vibrations
is small, and the note corresponding to this difference,
therefore, low in pitch. Lengthening one of the
tubes by means of its slider, the resultant tone rises
gradually, and now it swells surprisingly. When the
tube is shortened the resultant tone falls, and thus, by
alternately raising and lowering the slider, the resultant
tone is caused to rise and sink in accordance with the
law which makes the number of its vibrations the difference
between the number of its two primaries.</p>

<p>We can determine, with ease, the actual number of
vibrations corresponding to any one of those resultant
tones. The sound of the flame is that of the open tube
which surrounds it, and we have already learned (Chapter
III.) that the length of such a tube is half that of the
sonorous wave it produces. The wave-length, therefore,
corresponding to our 10-3/8-inch tube is 20-3/4 inches. The
velocity of sound in air of the present temperature is 1,120
feet a second. Bringing these feet to inches, and dividing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
by 20-3/4, we find the number of vibrations corresponding to
a length of 10-3/8 inches to be 648 per second.</p>

<p>But it must not be forgotten here that the air in
which the vibrations are actually executed is much more
elastic than the surrounding air. The flame heats the air
of the tube, and the vibrations must, therefore, be executed
more rapidly than they would be in an ordinary
organ-pipe of the same length. To determine the actual
number of vibrations, we must fall back upon our siren;
and with this instrument it is found that the air within
the 10-3/8 inch tube executes 717 vibrations in a second.
The difference of 69 vibrations a second is due to the
heating of the aërial column. Carbonic acid and aqueous
vapor are, moreover, the product of the flame’s combustion,
and their presence must also affect the rapidity of
the vibration.</p>

<p>Determining in the same way the rate of vibration of
the 11·4-inch tube, we find it to be 667 per second; the
difference between this number and 717 is 50, which expresses
the rate of vibration corresponding to the first
deep resultant tone.</p>

<p>But this number does not mark the limit of audibility.
Permitting the 11·4-inch tube to remain as before, and
lengthening its neighbor, the resultant tone sinks near
the limit of hearing. When the shorter tube measures
11 inches, the deep sound of the resultant tone is still
heard. The number of vibrations per second executed in
this 11-inch tube is 700. We have already found the
number executed in the 11·4-inch tube to be 667; hence
700-667=33, which is the number of vibrations corresponding
to the resultant tone now plainly heard when
the attention is converged upon it. We here come very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
near the limit which Helmholtz has fixed as that of
musical audibility. Combining the sound of a tube 17-3/8
inches in length with that of a 10-3/8-inch tube, we obtain
a resultant tone of higher pitch than any previously
heard. Now the actual number of vibrations executed in
the longer tube is 459; and we have already found the
vibrations of our 10-3/8-inch tube to be 717; hence 717-459=258,
which is the number corresponding to the resultant
tone now audible. This note is almost exactly
that of one of our series of tuning-forks, which vibrates
256 times in a second.</p>

<p>And now we will avail ourselves of a beautiful check
which this result suggests to us. The well-known fork
which vibrates at the rate just mentioned is here,
mounted on its case, and I touch it with the bow so
lightly that the sound alone could hardly be heard; but
it instantly coalesces with the resultant tone, and the
beats produced by their combination are clearly audible.
By loading the fork, and thus altering its pitch, or by
drawing up the paper slider, and thus altering the pitch
of the flame, the rate of these beats can be altered,
exactly as when we compare two primary tones together.
By slightly varying the size of the flame, the same effect
is produced. We cannot fail to observe how beautifully
these results harmonize with each other.</p>

<p>Standing midway between the siren and a shrill
singing-flame, and gradually raising the pitch of the
siren, the resultant tone soon makes itself heard, sometimes
swelling out with extraordinary power. When a
pitch-pipe is blown near the flame, the resultant tone is
also heard, seeming, in this case, to originate in the ear
itself, or rather in the brain. By gradually drawing out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
the stopper of the pipe, the pitch of the resultant tone
is caused to vary in accordance with the law already
enunciated.</p>

<p>The resultant tones produced by the combination of
the ordinary harmonic intervals<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> are given in the following

<p>The celebrated Thomas Young thought that these resultant
tones were due to the coalescence of rapid beats,
which linked themselves together like the periodic impulses
of an ordinary musical note. This explanation
harmonized with the fact that the number of the beats,
like that of the vibrations of the resultant tone, is equal
to the difference between the two sets of vibrations.
This explanation, however, is insufficient. The beats tell
more forcibly upon the ear than any continuous sound.
They can be plainly heard when each of the two sounds
that produce them has ceased to be audible. This depends
in part upon the sense of hearing, but it also
depends upon the fact that when two notes of the same
intensity produce beats, the amplitude of the vibrating
air-particles is at times destroyed, and at times doubled.
But by doubling the amplitude we quadruple the intensity
of the sound. Hence, when two notes of the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>intensity produce beats, <em>the sound incessantly varies between
silence and a tone of four times the intensity of either of the
interfering ones</em>.</p>

<p>If, therefore, the resultant tones were due to the beats
of their primaries, they ought to be heard, even when the
primaries are feeble. But they are not heard under these
circumstances. When several sounds traverse the same
air, each particular sound passes through the air as if it
alone were present, each particular element of a composite
sound asserting its own individuality. Now, this
is in strictness true only when the amplitudes of the
oscillating particles are infinitely small. Guided by pure
reasoning, the mathematician arrives at this result. The
law is also practically true when the disturbances are
<em>extremely</em> small; but it is <em>not</em> true after they have passed
a certain limit. Vibrations which produce a large amount
of disturbance give birth to secondary waves, which appeal
to the ear as resultant tones. This has been proved
by Helmholtz, and, having proved this, he inferred further
that there are also resultant tones formed by the
<em>sum</em> of the primaries, as well as by their difference. He
thus discovered the <em>summation-tones</em> before he had heard
them; and bringing his result to the test of experiment,
he found that these tones had a real physical existence.
They are not at all to be explained by Young’s theory.</p>

<p>Another consequence of this departure from the law
of superposition is, that a single sounding body, which
disturbs the air beyond the limits of the law of superposition,
also produces secondary waves, which correspond
to the harmonic tones of the vibrating body. For example,
the rate of vibration of the first overtone of a
tuning-fork, as stated in the fourth chapter, is 6-1/4 times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
the rate of the fundamental tone. But Helmholtz shows
that a tuning-fork, not excited by a bow, but vigorously
struck against a pad, emits the <em>octave</em> of its fundamental
note, this octave being due to the secondary waves set
up when the limits of the law of superposition have been
exceeded.</p>

<p>These considerations make it probably evident to you
that a coalescence of musical sounds is a far more complicated
dynamical condition than you have hitherto supposed
it to be. In the music of an orchestra, not only
have we the fundamental tones of every pipe and of every
string, but we have the overtones of each, sometimes audible
as far as the sixteenth in the series. We have also
resultant tones; both difference-tones and summation-tones;
all trembling through the same air, all knocking
at the self-same tympanic membrane. We have fundamental
tone interfering with fundamental tone; overtone
with overtone; resultant tone with resultant tone. And,
besides this, we have the members of each class interfering
with the members of every other class. The imagination
retires baffled from any attempt to realize the
physical condition of the atmosphere through which these
sounds are passing. And, as we shall immediately learn,
the aim of music, through the centuries during which it
has ministered to the pleasure of man, has been to arrange
matters empirically, so that the ear shall not suffer from
the discordance produced by this multitudinous interference.
The musicians engaged in this work knew nothing
of the physical facts and principles involved in their
efforts; they knew no more about it than the inventors of
gunpowder knew about the law of atomic proportions.
They tried and tried till they obtained a satisfactory re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>sult;
and now, when the scientific mind is brought to
bear upon the subject, order is seen rising through the
confusion, and the results of pure empiricism are found
to be in harmony with natural law.</p>


<h3>SUMMARY OF CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<p>When several systems of waves proceeding from distinct
centres of disturbance pass through water or air, the
motion of every particle is the algebraic sum of the several
motions impressed upon it.</p>

<p>In the case of water, when the crests of one system of
waves coincide with the crests of another system, higher
waves will be the result of the coalescence of the two
systems. But when the crests of one system coincide
with the sinuses, or furrows, of the other system, the two
systems, in whole or in part, destroy each other.</p>

<p>This coalescence and destruction of two systems of
waves is called <em>interference</em>.</p>

<p>Similar remarks apply to sonorous waves. If in two
systems of sonorous waves condensation coincides with
condensation, and rarefaction with rarefaction, the sound
produced by such coincidence is louder than that produced
by either system taken singly. But if the condensations
of the one system coincide with the rarefactions
of the other, a destruction, total or partial, of both systems
is the consequence.</p>

<p>Thus, when two organ-pipes of the same pitch are
placed near each other on the same wind-chest and
thrown into vibration, they so influence each other that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
as the air enters the embouchure of the one it quits that
of the other. At the moment, therefore, the one pipe
produces a condensation the other produces a rarefaction.
The sounds of two such pipes mutually destroy each other.</p>

<p>When two musical sounds of nearly the same pitch are
sounded together the flow of the sound is disturbed by
<em>beats</em>.</p>

<p>These beats are due to the alternate coincidence and
interference of the two systems of sonorous waves. If
the two sounds be of the same intensity, their coincidence
produces a sound of four times the intensity of
either; while their opposition produces absolute silence.</p>

<p>The effect, then, of two such sounds, in combination,
is a series of shocks, which we have called “beats,” separated
from each other by a series of “pauses.”</p>

<p>The rate at which the beats succeed each other is
equal to the difference between the two rates of vibration.</p>

<p>When a bell or disk sounds, the vibrations on opposite
sides of the same nodal line partially neutralize each
other; when a tuning-fork sounds, the vibrations of its
two prongs in part neutralize each other. By cutting off
a portion of the vibrations in these cases the sound may
be intensified.</p>

<p>When a luminous beam, reflected on to a screen from
two tuning-forks producing beats, is acted upon by the
vibrations of both, the intermittence of the sound is announced
by the alternate lengthening and shortening of
the band of light upon the screen.</p>

<p>The law of the superposition of vibrations above enunciated
is strictly true only when the amplitudes are exceedingly
small. When the disturbance of the air by
a sounding body is so violent that the law no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
holds good, secondary waves are formed, which correspond
to the harmonic tones of the sounding body.</p>

<p>When two tones are rendered so intense as to exceed
the limits of the law of superposition, their secondary
waves combine to produce <em>resultant tones</em>.</p>

<p>Resultant tones are of two kinds; the one class corresponding
to rates of vibration equal to the difference of
the rates of the two primaries; the other class corresponding
to rates of vibration equal to the sum of the two primaries.
The former are called <em>difference-tones</em>, the latter
<em>summation-tones</em>.</p>

<h3>§ 1. <i>The Facts of Musical Consonance</i></h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE subject of this day’s lecture has two sides, a
physical and an æsthetical. We have to-day to
study the question of musical consonance—to examine
musical sounds in definite combination with each
other, and to unfold the reason why some combinations
are pleasant and others unpleasant to the ear.</p>

<p>Pythagoras made the first step toward the physical
explanation of the musical intervals. This great philosopher
stretched a string, and then divided it into three
equal parts. At one of its points of division he fixed
it firmly, thus converting it into two, one of which was
twice the length of the other. He sounded the two sections
of the string simultaneously, and found the note
emitted by the short section to be the higher octave of
that emitted by the long one. He then divided his string
into two parts, bearing to each other the proportion of
2:3, and found that the notes were separated by an interval
of a fifth. Thus, dividing his string at different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
points, Pythagoras found the so-called consonant intervals
in music to correspond with certain lengths of his
string; and he made the extremely important discovery
that <em>the simpler the ratio of the two parts into which the
string was divided, the more perfect was the harmony of
the two sounds</em>. Pythagoras went no further than this,
and it remained for the investigators of a subsequent age
to show that the strings act in this way in virtue of the
relation of their lengths to the number of their vibrations.
Why simplicity should give pleasure remained
long an enigma, the only pretence of a solution being
that of Euler, which, briefly expressed, is, that the human
soul takes a constitutional delight in simple calculations.</p>

<p>The double siren (Fig. 163) enables us to obtain a
great variety of combinations of musical sounds. And
this instrument possesses over all others the advantage
that, by simply counting the number of orifices corresponding
respectively to any two notes, we obtain immediately
the ratio of their rates of vibration. Before proceeding
to these combinations I will enter a little more
fully into the action of the double siren than has been
hitherto deemed necessary or desirable.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_412.jpg" width="400" height="663" alt="Fig. 163." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 163.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The instrument, as already stated, consists of two of
Dove’s sirens, <span class="smcap">C′</span> and <span class="smcap">C</span>, connected by a common axis, the
upper one being turned upside down. Each siren is provided
with four series of apertures, numbering as follows:</p>

<table summary="numbering"><tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td><td class="tdc">Upper siren<br />&nbsp;Number of apertures&nbsp;</td><td class="tdc">Lower siren<br />&nbsp;Number of apertures&nbsp;</td></tr><tr>

<td>1st Series&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="tdc">16</td><td class="tdc">18</td></tr><tr>
<td>2d Series</td><td class="tdc">15</td><td class="tdc">12</td></tr><tr>
<td>3d Series</td><td class="tdc">12</td><td class="tdc">10</td></tr><tr>
<td>4th Series</td><td class="tdc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9</td><td class="tdc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8</td></tr></table>

<p>The number 12, it will be observed, is common to both
sirens. I open the two series of 12 orifices each, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a><br /><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>urge air through the instrument; both sounds flow together
in perfect unison; the unison being maintained,
however the pitch may be exalted. We have, however,
already learned (Chapter II.) that by turning the handle
of the upper siren the orifices in its wind-chest <span class="smcap">C′</span> are
caused either to meet those of its rotating disk, or to
retreat from them, the pitch of the upper siren being
thereby raised or lowered. This change of pitch instantly
announces itself by beats. The more rapidly the
handle is turned, the more is the tone of the upper siren
raised above or depressed below that of the lower one,
and, as a consequence, the more rapid are the beats.</p>

<p>Now the rotation of the handle is so related to the
rotation of the wind-chest <span class="smcap">C′</span> that when the handle turns
through half a right angle the wind-chest turns through
one-sixth of a right angle, or through the one-twenty-fourth
of its whole circumference. But in the case now
before us, where the circle is perforated by 12 orifices,
the rotation through one-twenty-fourth of its circumference
causes the apertures of the upper wind-chest to be
closed at the precise moments when those of the lower
one are opened, and <em>vice versa</em>. It is plain, therefore,
that the intervals between the puffs of the lower siren,
which correspond to the rarefactions of its sonorous waves,
are here filled by the puffs, or condensations, of the upper
siren. In fact, the condensations of the one coincide with
the rarefactions of the other, and the absolute extinction
of the sounds of both sirens is the consequence.</p>

<p>I may seem to you to have exceeded the truth here;
for when the handle is placed in the position which corresponds
to absolute extinction, you still hear a distinct
sound. And, when the handle is turned continuously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
though alternate swellings and sinkings of the tone
occur, the sinkings by no means amount to absolute
silence. The reason is this: The sound of the siren is
a highly composite one. By the suddenness and violence
of its shocks, not only does it produce waves corresponding
to the number of its orifices, but the aërial disturbance
breaks up into secondary waves, which associate
themselves with the primary waves of the instrument,
exactly as the harmonics of a string, or of an open
organ-pipe, mix with their fundamental tone. When the
siren sounds, therefore, it emits, besides the fundamental
tone, its octave, its twelfth, its double octave, and so on.
That is to say, it breaks the air up into vibrations which
have twice, three times, four times, etc., the rapidity of
the fundamental one. Now, by turning the upper siren
through one-twenty-fourth of its circumference, we extinguish
utterly the fundamental tone. But we do not
extinguish its octave.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> Hence, when the handle is in the
position which corresponds to the extinction of the fundamental
tone, instead of silence we have the full first
harmonic of the instrument.</p>

<p>Helmholtz has surrounded both his upper and his
lower siren with circular brass boxes, <span class="smcap">B</span>, <span class="smcap">B′</span>, each composed
of two halves, which can be readily separated (one-half
of each box is removed in the figure). These boxes
exalt by their resonance the fundamental tone of the
instrument, and enable us to follow its variations much
more easily than if it were not thus reinforced. It requires
a certain rapidity of rotation to reach the maximum
resonance of the brass boxes; but when this speed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>is attained, the fundamental tone swells out with greatly
augmented force, and, if the handle be then turned, the
beats succeed each other with extraordinary power.</p>

<p>Still, as already stated, the pauses between the beats
of the fundamental tone are not intervals of absolute
silence, but are filled by the higher octave; and this
renders caution necessary when the instrument is employed
to determine rates of vibration. It is not without
reason that I say so. Wishing to determine the rate
of vibration of a small singing-flame, I once placed a
siren at some distance from it, sounded the instrument,
and after a little time observed the flame dancing in
synchronism with audible beats. I took it for granted
that unison was nearly attained, and, under this assumption,
determined the rate of vibration. The number obtained
was surprisingly low—indeed not more than half
what it ought to be. What was the reason? Simply
this: I was dealing, not with the fundamental tone of the
siren, but with its higher octave. This octave and the
flame produced beats by their coalescence; and hence
the counter of the instrument, which recorded the rate,
not of the octave, but of the fundamental, gave a number
which was only half the true one. The fundamental
tone was afterward raised to unison with the flame. On
approaching unison beats were again heard, and the
jumping of the flame proceeded with an energy greater
than that observed in the case of the octave. The counter
of the instrument then recorded the accurate rate of
the flame’s vibration.</p>

<p>The tones first heard in the case of the siren are always
overtones. These attain sonorous continuity sooner
than the fundamental, flowing as smooth musical sounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
while the fundamental tone is still in a state of intermittence.
The siren is, however, so delicately constructed
that a rate of rotation which raises the fundamental tone
above its fellows is almost immediately attained. And if
we seek, by making the blast feeble, to keep the speed
of rotation low, it is at the expense of intensity. Hence
the desirability, if we wish to examine the overtones, of
devising some means by which a strong blast and slow
rotation shall be possible.</p>

<p>Helmholtz caused a spring to press as a light brake
against the disk of the siren. Thus raising by slow
degrees the speed of rotation, he was able deliberately
to notice the predominance of the overtones at the commencement,
and the final triumph of the fundamental
tone. He did not trust to the direct observation of
pitch, but determined the tone by the number of beats
corresponding to one revolution of the handle of the
upper siren. Supposing 12 orifices to be opened above
and 12 below, the motion of the handle through 45°
produces interference, and extinguishes the fundamental
tone. The coincidences of that tone occur at the end of
every rotation of 90°. Hence, for the fundamental tone,
there must be <em>four</em> beats for every complete rotation of
the handle. Now Helmholtz, when he made the arrangement
just described, found that the first beats numbered,
not 4, but 12, for every revolution. They were, in fact,
the beats, not of the fundamental tone, not even of the
first overtone, but of the second overtone, whose rate of
vibration is three times that of the fundamental. These
beats continued as long as the number of air-shocks did
not exceed 30 or 40 per second. When the shocks were
between 40 and 80 per second, the beats fell from 12 to 8<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
for every revolution of the handle. Within this interval
the first overtone, or the octave of the fundamental tone,
was the most powerful, and made the beats its own. Not
until the impulses exceeded 80 per second did the beats sink
to 4 per revolution. In other words, not until the speed
of rotation had passed this limit was the fundamental tone
able to assert its superiority over its companions.</p>

<p>This premised, we will combine the tones in definite
order, while the cultivated ears here present shall judge
of their musical relationship. The flow of perfect unison
when the two series of 12 orifices each are opened has
been already heard. I now open a series of 8 holes in
the upper and of 16 in the lower siren. The interval
you judge at once to be an octave. If a series of 9
holes in the upper and of 18 holes in the lower siren
be opened, the interval is still an octave. This proves
that the interval is not disturbed by altering the absolute
rates of vibration, so long as the <em>ratio</em> of the two rates
remains the same. The same truth is more strikingly
illustrated by commencing with a low speed of rotation,
and urging the siren to its highest pitch; as long as the
orifices are in the ratio of 1:2, we retain the constant
interval of an octave. Opening a series of 10 holes in
the upper and of 15 in the lower siren, the ratio is as
2:3, and every musician present knows that this is the
interval of a fifth. Opening 12 holes in the upper and
18 in the lower siren does not change the interval.
Opening two series of 9 and 12, or of 12 and 16, we
obtain an interval of a fourth; the ratio in both these
cases being as 3:4. In like manner two series of 8 and
10, or of 12 and 15, give us the interval of a major
third; the ratio in this case being as 4:5. Finally, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
series of 10 and 12, or of 15 and 18, yield the interval
of a minor third, which corresponds to the ratio 5:6.</p>

<p>These experiments amply illustrate two things: First,
that a musical interval is determined, not by the absolute
number of vibrations of the two combining notes, but by
the ratio of their vibrations. Secondly, and this is of the
utmost significance, that the smaller the two numbers
which express the ratio of the two rates of vibration,
the more perfect is the consonance of the two sounds.
The most perfect consonance is the unison 1:1; next
comes the octave 1:2; after that the fifth 2:3; then the
fourth 3:4; then the major third 4:5; and finally the
minor third 5:6. We can also open two series numbering,
respectively, 8 and 9 orifices: this interval corresponds
to <em>a tone</em> in music. It is a dissonant combination.
Two series which number respectively 15 and 16
orifices make the interval of a <em>semi-tone</em>: it is a very
sharp and grating dissonance.</p>


<h3>§ 2. <i>The Theory of Musical Consonance. Pythagoras
and Euler</i></h3>

<p>Whence, then, does this arise? Why should the smaller
ratio express the more perfect consonance? The ancients
attempted to solve this question. The Pythagoreans found
intellectual repose in the answer “All is number and harmony.”
The numerical relations of the seven notes
of the musical scale were also thought by them to express
the distances of the planets from their central fire;
hence the choral dance of the worlds, the “music of
the spheres,” which, according to his followers, Pythagoras
alone was privileged to hear. And might we not in
passing contrast this glorious superstition with the grov<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>elling
delusion which has taken hold of the fantasy of
our day? Were the character which superstition assumes
in different ages an indication of man’s advance or retrogression,
assuredly the nineteenth century would have no
reason to plume itself, in comparison with the sixth <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
A more earnest attempt to account for the more perfect
consonance of the smaller ratios was made by the celebrated
mathematician, Euler, and his explanation, if such
it could be called, long silenced, if it did not satisfy, inquirers.
Euler analyzes the cause of pleasure. We take
delight in <em>order</em>; it is pleasant to us to observe means
“co-operant to an end.” But then, the effort to discern
order must not be so great as to weary us. If the relations
to be disentangled are too complicated, though we
may see the order, we cannot enjoy it. The simpler the
terms in which the order expresses itself, the greater is
our delight. Hence the superiority of the simpler ratios
in music over the more complex ones. Consonance, then,
according to Euler, was the satisfaction derived from the
perception of order without weariness of mind.</p>

<p>But in this theory it was overlooked that Pythagoras
himself, who first experimented on the musical intervals,
knew nothing about rates of vibration. It was forgotten
that the vast majority of those who take delight in
music, and who have the sharpest ears for the detection
of a dissonance, are in the condition of Pythagoras,
knowing nothing whatever about rates or ratios. And it
may also be added that the scientific man, who is fully
informed upon these points, has his pleasure in no way
enhanced by his knowledge. Euler’s explanation, therefore,
does not satisfy the mind, and it was reserved for an
eminent German investigator of our own day, after a pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>found
analysis of the entire question, to assign the physical
cause of consonance and dissonance—a cause which, when
once clearly stated, is so simple and satisfactory as to excite
surprise that it remained so long without a discoverer.</p>

<p>Various expressions employed in our previous lectures
have already, in part, forestalled Helmholtz’s explanation
of consonance and dissonance. Let me here repeat an
experiment which will, almost of itself, force this explanation
upon your attention. Before you are two jets of
burning gas, which can be converted into singing-flames
by inclosing them within two tubes (represented in <a href="#f118">Fig.
118</a>). The tubes are of the same length, and the flames
are now singing in unison. By means of a telescopic
slider I lengthen slightly one of the tubes; you hear
deliberate beats, which succeed each other so slowly that
they can readily be counted. I augment still further the
length of the tube. The beats are now more rapid than
before: they can barely be counted. It is perfectly manifest
that the shocks of which you are now sensible differ
only in point of rapidity from the slow beats which you
heard a moment ago. There is no breach of continuity
here. We begin slowly, we gradually increase the rapidity,
until finally the succession of the beats is so rapid
as to produce that particular grating effect which every
musician that hears it would call <em>dissonance</em>. Let us now
reverse the process, and pass from these quick beats to
slow ones. The same continuity of the phenomenon is
noticed. By degrees the beats separate from each other
more and more, until finally they are slow enough to be
counted. Thus these singing-flames enable us to follow
the beats with certainty, until they cease to be beats and
are converted into dissonance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span></p>

<p>This experiment proves conclusively that dissonance
<em>may</em> be produced by a rapid succession of beats; and I
imagine this cause of dissonance would have been pointed
out earlier, had not men’s minds been thrown off the
proper track by the theory of “resultant tones” enunciated
by Thomas Young. Young imagined that, when
they were quick enough, the beats ran together to form
a resultant tone. He imagined the linking together of
the beats to be precisely analogous to the linking together
of simple musical impulses; and he was strengthened
in this notion by the fact already adverted to, that
the first difference-tone, that is to say, the loudest resultant
tone, corresponded, as the beats do, to a rate of
vibration equal to the difference of the rates of the two
primaries. The fact, however, is that the effect of beats
upon the ear is altogether different from that of the successive
impulses of an ordinary musical tone.</p>


<h3>§ 3. <i>Sympathetic Vibrations</i></h3>

<p>But to grasp, in all its fulness, the new theory of
musical consonance some preliminary studies will be
necessary. And here I would ask you to call to mind
the experiments (in Chapter III.) by which the division
of a string into its harmonic segments was illustrated.
This was done by means of little paper riders, which
were unhorsed, or not, according as they occupied a
ventral segment or a node upon the string. Before you
at present is the sonometer, employed in the experiments
just referred to. Along it, instead of one, are stretched
two strings, about three inches asunder. By means of a
key these strings are brought into unison. And now I
place a little paper rider upon the middle of one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
them, and agitate the other. What occurs? The vibrations
of the sounding string are communicated to the
bridges on which it rests, and through the bridges to
the other string. The individual impulses are very feeble,
but, because the two strings are in unison, the impulses
can so accumulate as finally to toss the rider off the
untouched string.</p>

<p>Every experiment executed with the riders and a
single string may be repeated with these two unisonant
strings. Damping, for instance, one of the strings, at a
point one-fourth of its length from one of its ends, and
placing the red and blue riders formerly employed, not
on the nodes and ventral segments of the damped string,
but at points upon the second string exactly opposite to
those nodes and segments, when the bow is passed across
the shorter segment of the damped string, the five red
riders on the adjacent string are unhorsed, while the four
blue ones remain tranquilly in their places. By relaxing
one of the strings, it is thrown out of unison with the
other, and then all efforts to unhorse the riders are unavailing.
That accumulation of impulses, which unison
alone renders possible, cannot here take place, and the
consequence is that, however great the agitation of the
one string may be, it fails to produce any sensible effect
upon the other.</p>

<p>The influence of synchronism may be illustrated in a
still more striking manner, by means of two tuning-forks
which sound the same note. Two such forks mounted
on their resonant supports are placed upon the table. I
draw the bow vigorously across one of them, permitting
the other fork to remain untouched. On stopping the
agitated fork, the sound is enfeebled, but by no means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
quenched. Through the air and through the wood the
vibrations have been conveyed from fork to fork, and
the untouched fork is the one you now hear. When, by
means of a morsel of wax, a small coin is attached to
one of the forks, its power of influencing the other
ceases; the change in the rate of vibration, if not very
small, so destroys the sympathy between the two forks as
to render a response impossible. On removing the coin
the untouched fork responds as before.</p>

<p>This communication of vibrations through wood and
air may be obtained when the forks, mounted on their
cases, stand several feet apart. But the vibrations may
also be communicated through the air alone. Holding the
resonant case of a vigorously vibrating fork in my hand,
I bring one of its prongs near an unvibrating one, placing
the prongs back to back, but allowing a space of air to
exist between them. Light as is the vehicle, the accumulation
of impulses, secured by the perfect unison of the
two forks, enables the one to set the other in vibration.
Extinguishing the sound of the agitated fork, that which
a moment ago was silent continues sounding, having
taken up the vibrations of its neighbor. Removing one
of the forks from its resonant case, and striking it against
a pad, it is thrown into strong vibration. Held free in
the air, its sound is audible. But, on bringing it close
to the silent mounted fork, out of the silence rises a full
mellow sound, which is due, not to the fork originally
agitated, but to its sympathetic neighbor.</p>

<p>Various other examples of the influence of synchronism,
already brought forward, will occur to you here;
and cases of the kind might be indefinitely multiplied.
If two clocks, for example, with pendulums of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
period of vibration, be placed against the same wall, and
if one of the clocks is set going and the other not, the
ticks of the moving clock, transmitted through the wall,
will act upon its neighbor. The quiescent pendulum,
moved by a single tick, swings through an extremely
minute arc; but it returns to the limit of its swing just
in time to receive another impulse. By the continuance
of this process, the impulses so add themselves together
as finally to set the clock a-going. It is by this timing
of impulses that a properly-pitched voice can cause a
glass to ring, and that the sound of an organ can break
a particular window-pane.</p>


<h3>§ 4. <i>Sympathetic Vibration in Relation to the Human Ear</i></h3>

<p>If I dwell so fully upon this object, it is for the
purpose of rendering intelligible the manner in which
sonorous motion is communicated to the auditory nerve.
In the organ of hearing, in man, we have first of all
the external orifice of the ear, closed at the bottom by
the circular tympanic membrane. Behind that membrane
is the drum of the ear, this cavity being separated from
the space between it and the brain by a bony partition,
in which there are two orifices, the one round and the
other oval. These orifices are also closed by fine membranes.
Across the drum stretches a series of four little
bones. The first, called the <em>hammer</em>, is attached to the
tympanic membrane; the second, called the <em>anvil</em>, is connected
by a joint with the hammer; a third little round
bone connects the anvil with the <em>stirrup-bone</em>, the base of
which is planted against the membrane of the oval orifice
just referred to. This oval membrane is almost covered
by the stirrup-bone, a narrow rim only of the membrane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
surrounding the bone being left uncovered. Behind the
bony partition, and between it and the brain, we have
the extraordinary organ called the <em>labyrinth</em>, filled with
water, over the lining membrane of which are distributed
the terminal fibres of the auditory nerve. When the
tympanic membrane receives a shock, it is transmitted
through the series of bones above referred to, being concentrated
on the membrane against which the base of the
stirrup-bone is fixed. The membrane transfers the shock
to the water of the labyrinth, which, in its turn, transfers
it to the nerves.</p>

<p>The transmission, however, is not direct. At a certain
place within the labyrinth exceedingly fine elastic bristles,
terminating in sharp points, grow up between the terminal
nerve-fibres. These bristles, discovered by Max Schultze,
are eminently calculated to sympathize with such vibrations
of the water as correspond to their proper periods.
Thrown thus into vibration, the bristles stir the nerve-fibres
which lie between their roots. At another place in
the labyrinth we have little crystalline particles called
<em>otolites</em>—the Hörsteine of the Germans—imbedded among
the nervous filaments, which, when they vibrate, exert an
intermittent pressure upon the adjacent nerve-fibres. The
otolites probably serve a different purpose from that of
the bristles of Schultze. They are fitted, by their weight,
to accept and prolong the vibrations of evanescent
sounds, which might otherwise escape attention, while
the bristles of Schultze, because of their extreme lightness,
would instantly yield up an evanescent motion.
They are, on the other hand, eminently fitted for the
transmission of continuous vibrations.</p>

<p>Finally, there is in the labyrinth an organ, discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
by the Marchese Corti, which is to all appearance a musical
instrument, with its chords so stretched as to accept
vibrations of different periods, and transmit them to the
nerve-filaments which traverse the organ. Within the ears
of men, and without their knowledge or contrivance, this
lute of 3,000 strings<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> has existed for ages, accepting the
music of the outer world and rendering it fit for reception
by the brain. Each musical tremor which falls upon
this organ selects from the stretched fibres the one appropriate
to its own pitch, and throws it into unisonant
vibration. And thus, no matter how complicated the
motion of the external air may be, these microscopic
strings can analyze it and reveal the constituents of
which it is composed. Surely, inability to feel the stupendous
wonder of what is here revealed would imply
incompleteness of mind; and surely those who practically
ignore, or fear them, must be ignorant of the ennobling
influence which such discoveries may be made
to exercise upon both the emotions and the understanding
of man.</p>


<h3>§ 5. <i>Consonant Intervals in Relation to the Human Ear</i></h3>

<p>This view of the use of Corti’s fibres is theoretical;
but it comes to us commended by every appearance of
truth. It will enable us to tie together many things,
whose relations it would be otherwise difficult to discern.
When a musical note is sounded its corresponding Corti’s
fibre resounds, being moved, as a string is moved by a
second unisonant string. And when two sounds coalesce
to produce beats, the intermittent motion is transferred
to the proper fibre within the ear. But here it is to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
noted that, for the same fibre to be affected simultaneously
by two different sounds, it must not be far removed
in pitch from either of them. Call to mind our
repetition of Melde’s experiments (in Chapter III.). You
then had frequent occasion to notice that, even before
perfect synchronism had been established between the
string and the tuning-fork to which it was attached,
the string began to respond to the fork. But you also
noticed how rapidly the vibrating amplitude of the string
increased, as it came close to perfect synchronism with
the vibrating fork. On approaching unison the string
would open out, say to an amplitude of an inch; and
then a slight tightening or slackening, as the case might
be, would bring it up to unison, and cause it to open
out suddenly to an amplitude of six inches.</p>

<p>So also in reference to the experiment made a moment
ago with the sonometer; you noticed that the unhorsing
of the paper riders was preceded by a fluttering
of the bits of paper; showing that the sympathetic response
of the second string had begun, though feebly,
prior to perfect synchronism. Instead of two strings,
conceive three strings, all nearly of the same pitch, to
be stretched upon the sonometer; and suppose the vibrating
period of the middle string to lie midway between
the periods of its two neighbors, being a little higher
than the one and a little lower than the other. Each of
the side strings, sounded singly, would cause the middle
string to respond. Sounding the two side strings together
they would produce beats; the corresponding
intermittence would be propagated to the central string,
which would beat in synchronism with the beats of its
neighbors. In this way we make plain to our minds how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
a Corti’s fibre may, to some extent, take up the vibrations
of a note, nearly, but not exactly, in unison with
its own; and that when two notes close to the pitch of
the fibre act upon it together, their beats are responded
to by an intermittent motion on the part of the fibre.
This power of sympathetic vibration would fall rapidly on
both sides of the perfect unison, so that on increasing the
interval between the two notes, a time would soon arrive
when the same fibre would refuse to be acted on simultaneously
by both. Here the condition of the organ, necessary
for the perception of audible beats, would cease.</p>

<p>In the middle region of the pianoforte, with the interval
of a semitone, the beats are sharp and distinct,
falling indeed upon the ear as a grating dissonance. Extending
the interval to a whole tone, the beats become
more rapid, but less distinct. With the interval of a
minor third between the two notes, the beats in the middle
region of the scale cease to be sensible. But this
smoothening of the sound is not wholly due to the augmented
rapidity of the beats. It is due in part to the
fact, for which the foregoing considerations have prepared
us, that the two notes here sounded are too far
removed from that of the intermediate Corti’s fibre to
affect it powerfully. By ascending to the higher regions
of the scale we can produce, with a narrower interval
than the minor third, the same, or even a greater, number
of beats, which are sharply distinguishable because of the
closeness of their component notes. In the very highest
regions of the scale, however, the beats, when they become
very rapid, cease to appeal as roughness to the ear.</p>

<p>Hence both the rapidity of the beats, and the width
of the interval, enter into the question of consonance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
Helmholtz judges that in the middle and higher regions
of the musical scale, when the beats reach 33 per second,
the dissonance reaches its maximum. Both slower and
quicker beats have a less grating or dissonant effect.
When the beats are very slow, they may be of advantage
to the music; and, when they reach 132 per second, their
roughness is no longer discernible.</p>

<p>Thanks to Helmholtz, whose views I have here sought
to express in the briefest possible language, we are now
in a condition to grapple with the question of musical
intervals, and to give the reason why some are consonant
and some dissonant to the ear. Circumstanced as we are
upon earth, all our feelings and emotions, from the lowest
sensation to the highest æsthetic consciousness, have
a mechanical cause: though it may be forever denied to
us to take the step from cause to effect; or to understand
why the agitations of nervous matter can awaken the
delights which music imparts. Take, then, the case of a
violin. The fundamental tone of every string of this instrument
is demonstrably accompanied by a crowd of overtones;
so that, when two violins are sounded, we have
not only to take into account the consonance or dissonance
of the fundamental tones, but also those of the
higher tones of both. Supposing two strings sounded
whose fundamental tones, and all of whose partial tones,
coincide, we have then absolute unison; and this we actually
have when the ratio of vibration is 1:1. So also
when the ratio of vibration is accurately 1:2, each overtone
of the fundamental finds itself in absolute coincidence
with either the fundamental tone or some higher tone of
the octave. There is no room for beats or dissonance.
When we examine the interval of a fifth, with a ratio of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
2:3, we find the coincidence of the partial tones of the
two so perfect as almost, though not wholly, to exclude
every trace of dissonance. Passing on to the other
intervals, we find the coincidence of the partial tones less
perfect, as the numbers expressing the ratio of the vibrations
become more large. Thus, the dissonance of intervals
whose rates of vibration can only be expressed by
large numbers, is not to be ascribed to any mystic quality
of the numbers themselves, but to the fact that the
fundamental tones which require such numbers are inexorably
accompanied by partial tones whose coalescence
produces beats, these producing the grating effect known
as dissonance.</p>


<h3>§ 6. <i>Graphic Representation of Consonance and Dissonance</i></h3>

<p>Helmholtz has attempted to represent this result
graphically, and from his work I copy, with some modification,
the next two diagrams. He assumes, as already
stated, the maximum dissonance to correspond to 33 beats
per second; and he seeks to express different degrees of
dissonance by lines of different lengths. The horizontal
line <i>c′ c″</i>, Fig. 164, represents a range of the musical scale
in which <i>c″</i> is our middle <span class="smcap">C</span>, with 528 vibrations, and <i>c′</i>
the lower octave of <i>c″</i>. The distance from any point of
this line to the curve above it represents the dissonance
corresponding to that point. The pitch here is supposed
to ascend continuously, and not by jumps. Supposing,
for example, two performers on the violin to start with
the same note <i>c′</i>, and that, while one of them continues
to sound that note, the other gradually and continuously
shortens his string, thus gradually raising its pitch up to
the octave <i>c″</i>. The effect upon the ear would be repre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>sented
by the irregular curved line in Fig. 164. Soon
after the unison, which is represented by contact at <i>c′</i>, is
departed from, the curve suddenly rises, showing the
dissonance here to be the sharpest of all. At <i>c′</i>, the
curve approaches the straight line <i>c′ c″</i>, and this point
corresponds to the major third. At <i>f′</i> the approach, is
still nearer, and this point corresponds to the fourth. At
<i>g′</i> the curve almost touches the straight line, indicating
that at this point, which corresponds to the fifth, the dissonance
almost vanishes. At <i>a′</i> we have the major sixth;
while at <i>c″</i>, where the one note is an octave above the
other, the dissonance entirely vanishes. The <i>e s′</i> and the
<i>a s′</i>, of this diagram are the German names of a
third and a flat sixth.</p>

<img src="images/i_431.jpg" width="400" height="156" alt="Fig. 164." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 164.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Maintaining the same fundamental note <i>c′</i>, and passing
through the octave above <i>c″</i>, the various degrees of consonance
and dissonance are those shown in Fig. 165.
That is to say, beginning with the octave <i>c′-c″</i>, and
gradually elevating the pitch of one of the strings till it
reaches <i>c″′</i>, the octave of <i>c″</i>, the curved line represents
the effect upon the ear. We see, from both these curves,
that dissonance is the general rule, and that only at certain
definite points does the dissonance vanish, or become
so decidedly enfeebled as not to destroy the harmony.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
These points correspond to the places where the numbers
expressing the ratio of the two rates of vibration are
small whole numbers. It must be remembered that these
curves are constructed on the supposition that the beats
are the cause of the dissonance; and the agreement between
calculation and experience sufficiently demonstrates
the truth of the assumption.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></p>

<p>You have thus accompanied me to the verge of the
Physical portion of the science of Acoustics, and through
the æsthetic portion I have not the knowledge of music
necessary to lead you. I will only add that, in comparing
three or more sounds together, that is to say, in choosing
them for <em>chords</em>, we are guided by the principles just mentioned.
We choose sounds which are in harmony with
the fundamental sound and with each other. In choosing
a series of sounds for combination two by two, the simplicity
alone of the ratios would lead us to fix on those
expressed by the numbers 1, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, 2; these being the
simplest ratios that we can have within an octave. But,
when the notes represented by these ratios are sounded
in succession, it is found that the intervals between 1
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
and 5/4, and between 5/3 and 2, are wider than the others,
and require the interpolation of a note in each case.
The notes chosen are such as form chords, not with
the fundamental tone, but with the note <i>3/2</i> regarded as
a fundamental tone. The ratios of these two notes with
the fundamental are 9/8 and 15/8. Interpolating these, we
have the eight notes of the natural or diatonic scale,
expressed by the following names and ratios:</p>

<table summary="diatonic scale"><tr>
<td>Names</td><td class="tdc">C.</td><td class="tdc">D.</td><td class="tdc">E.</td><td class="tdc">F.</td><td class="tdc">G.</td><td class="tdc">A.</td><td class="tdc">B.</td><td class="tdc">C′.</td></tr><tr>
<td>Intervals</td><td class="tdc">1st.</td><td class="tdc">2d.</td><td class="tdc">3d.</td><td class="tdc">4th.</td><td class="tdc">5th.</td><td class="tdc">6th.</td><td class="tdc">7th.</td><td class="tdc">8th.</td></tr><tr>

<p>Multiplying these ratios by 24, to avoid fractions, we
obtain the following series of whole numbers, which express
the relative rates of vibration of the notes of the
diatonic scale:</p>

<p class="center">24, 27, 30, 32, 36, 40, 45, 48.</p>

<p>The meaning of the terms third, fourth, fifth, etc.,
which we have so often applied to the musical intervals,
is now apparent; the term has reference to the position
of the note in the scale.</p>


<h3>§ 7. <i>Composition of Vibrations</i></h3>

<p>In our second lecture I referred to, and in part illustrated,
a method devised by M. Lissajous for studying
musical vibrations. By means of a beam of light reflected
from a mirror attached to a tuning-fork, the fork
was made to write the story of its own motion. In our
last lecture the same method was employed to illustrate
optically the phenomenon of beats. I now propose to
apply it to the study of the composition of the vibrations
which constitute the principal intervals of the diatonic
scale.  We must, however, prepare ourselves for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
thorough comprehension of this subject by a brief preliminary
examination of the vibrations of a common
pendulum.</p>

<p>Such a pendulum hangs before you. It consists of a
wire carefully fastened to a plate of iron at the roof of
the house, and bearing a copper ball weighing 10 lbs. I
draw the pendulum aside and let it go; it oscillates to
and fro almost in the same plane.</p>

<p>I say “almost,” because it is practically impossible to
suspend a pendulum without some little departure from
perfect symmetry around its point of attachment. In
consequence of this, the weight deviates sooner or later
from a straight line, and describes an oval more or less
elongated. Some years ago this circumstance presented
a serious difficulty to those who wished to repeat M.
Foucault’s celebrated experiment, demonstrating the rotation
of the earth.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in the case now before us, the pendulum
is so carefully suspended that its deviation from a
straight line is not at first perceptible. Let us suppose
the amplitude of its oscillation to be represented by the
dotted line <i>a b</i>, Fig. 166. The point <i>d</i>, midway between
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, is the pendulum’s point of rest. When drawn
aside from this point to <i>b</i>, and let go, it will return to <i>d</i>,
and in virtue of its momentum will pass on to <i>a</i>. There
it comes momentarily to rest, and returns through <i>d</i> to
<i>b</i>. And thus it will continue to oscillate until its motion
is expended.</p>

<p>The pendulum having first reached the limit of its
swing at <i>b</i>, let us suppose a push in a direction perpendicular
to <i>a b</i> imparted to it; that is to say, in the
direction <i>b c</i>. Supposing the time required by the pen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>dulum
to swing from <i>b</i> to <i>a</i> to be one second,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> then the
time required to swing from <i>b</i> to <i>d</i> will be half a second.
<span class="figleft125">
<img src="images/i_435a.jpg" width="125" height="120" alt="Fig. 166." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 166.</span></span>
</span>
Suppose, further, the force applied at <i>b</i>
to be such as would carry the bob, if
free to move in that direction alone, to
<i>c</i> in half a second, and that the distance
<i>b c</i> is equal to <i>b d</i>, the question then
occurs, where will the bob really find
itself at the end of half a second? It
<span class="figright">
<img src="images/i_435b.jpg" width="125" height="484" alt="Fig. 167." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 167.</span></span>
</span>
is perfectly manifest that both forces are satisfied
by the pendulum reaching the point <i>e</i>,
exactly opposite the centre <i>d</i>, in half a second.
To reach this point, it can be shown
that it must describe the circular arc <i>b e</i>, and
it will pursue its way along the continuation
of the same arc, to <i>a</i>, and then pass round to <i>b</i>.
Thus, by the rectangular impulse the rectilinear
oscillation is converted into a rotation,
the pendulum describing a circle, as shown in
Fig. 167.</p>





<p>If the force applied at <i>b</i> be sufficient to
urge the weight in half a second through a
greater distance than <i>b c</i>, the pendulum will
describe an ellipse, with the lines <i>a b</i> for its
smaller axis; if, on the contrary, the force
applied at <i>b</i> urge the pendulum in half a
second through a distance less than <i>b c</i>, the
weight will describe an ellipse, with the line
<i>a b</i> for its greater axis.</p>


<p>Let us now inquire what occurs when the rectangular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>impulse is applied at the moment the ball is passing
through its position of rest at <i>d</i>.</p>

<p>Supposing the pendulum to be moving from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>,
Fig. 168, and that at <i>d</i> a shock is imparted to it sufficient
of itself to carry it in half a second to <i>c</i>; it is here
manifest that the resultant motion will be along the
straight line <i>d g</i> lying between <i>b d</i> and <i>d c</i>. The pendulum
will return along this line to <i>d</i>, and pass on to <i>h</i>.
In this case, therefore, the pendulum will describe a
straight line, <i>g h</i>, oblique to its original direction of
oscillation.</p>

<p>Supposing the direction of motion at the moment the
push is applied to be from <i>b</i> to <i>a</i>, instead of from <i>a</i> to
<i>b</i>, it is manifest that the resultant here will also be a
straight line oblique to the primitive direction of oscillation;
but its obliquity will be that shown in Fig. 169.</p>

<p>When the impulse is imparted to the pendulum neither
at the centre nor at the limit of its swing, but at
some point between both, we obtain neither a circle nor
a straight line, but something between both. We have,
in fact, a more or less elongated ellipse with its axis
oblique to <i>a b</i>, the original direction of vibration. If, for
example, the impulse be imparted at <i>d′</i>, Fig. 170, while
the pendulum is moving toward <i>b</i>, the position of the
ellipse will be that shown in Fig. 170; but if the push at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
<i>d′</i> be given when the motion is toward <i>a</i>, then the position
of the ellipse will be that represented in Fig. 171.</p>

</div>

<p>By the method of M. Lissajous we can combine the
rectangular vibrations of two tuning-forks, a subject
which I now wish to illustrate before you. In front
of an electric lamp, <span class="smcap">L</span>, Fig. 172, is placed a large tuning-fork,
<span class="smcap">T′</span>, fixed in a stand horizontally, and provided with
a mirror, on which a narrow beam of light, <span class="smcap">L T′</span>, is permitted
to fall. The beam is thrown back, by reflection.
In the path of the reflected beam is placed a second
upright tuning-fork, <span class="smcap">T</span>, also furnished with a mirror. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
the horizontal fork, when it vibrates, the beam is tilted
laterally; by the vertical fork, vertically. At the present
moment both forks are motionless, the beam of light
being reflected from the mirror of the horizontal to that
of the vertical fork, and from the latter to the screen,
on which it prints a brilliant disk. I now agitate the
upright fork, leaving the other motionless. The disk is
drawn out into a fine luminous band, 3 feet long. On
sounding the second fork, the straight band is instantly
transformed into a white ring <i>o p</i>, Fig. 172, 36 inches in
diameter. What have we done here? Exactly what we
did in our first experiment with the pendulum. We
have caused a beam of light to vibrate simultaneously in
two directions, and have accidentally hit upon the phase
when one fork has just reached the limit of its swing
and come momentarily to rest, while the beam is receiving
the maximum impulse from the other fork.</p>

<p>That the <em>circle</em> was obtained is, as stated, a mere accident;
but it was a fortunate accident, as it enables us to
see the exact similarity between the motion of the beam
and that of the pendulum. I stop both forks, and, agitating
them afresh, obtain an ellipse with its axis oblique.
After a few trials we obtain the straight line,
indicating that both the forks then pass simultaneously
through their positions of equilibrium. In this way, by
combining the vibrations of the two forks, we reproduce
all the figures obtained with the pendulum.</p>

<p>When the vibrations of the two forks are, in all respects,
absolutely alike, whatever the figure may be which
is first traced upon the screen, it remains unchanged in
form, diminishing only in size as the motion is expended.
But the slightest difference in the rates of vibration de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>stroys
this fixity of the image. I endeavored before the
lecture to reader the unison between these two forks as
perfect as possible, and hence you have observed very
little alteration in the shape of the figure. But by moving
a small weight along the prong of either fork, or by
attaching to either of them a bit of wax, the unison is
impaired. The figure then obtained by the combination
of both passes slowly from a straight line into an oblique
ellipse, thence into a circle; after which it narrows again
to an ellipse with an opposed obliquity, it then passes
again into a straight line, the direction of which is at
right angles to the first direction. Finally, it passes, in
the reverse order, through the same series of figures
to the straight line with which we began. The interval
between two successive identical figures is the time
in which one of the forks succeeds in executing one
complete vibration more than the other. Loading the
fork still more heavily, we have more rapid changes;
the straight line, ellipse, and circle being passed through
in quick succession. At times the luminous curve exhibits
a stereoscopic depth, which renders it difficult to
believe that we are not looking at a solid ring of white-hot
metal.</p>

<p>By causing the mirror of the fork, <span class="smcap">T</span>, to rotate through
a small arc, the steady circle first obtained is drawn out
into a luminous scroll stretching right across the screen,
Fig. 173. The same experiment made with the changing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>
figure, obtained by throwing the forks out of unison,
gives us a scroll of irregular amplitude, Fig. 174.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></p>

<p>We have next to combine the vibrations of two forks,
one of which oscillates with twice the rapidity of the
other; in other words, to determine the figure corresponding
to the combination of a note and its octave.

To prepare ourselves for the mechanics
of the problem, we must resort once
more to our pendulum; for it also can
be caused to oscillate in one direction
twice as rapidly as in another. By
a complicated mechanical arrangement
this might be done in a very perfect
manner, but at present simplicity is
preferable to completeness. The wire
of our pendulum is therefore permitted
to descend from its point of suspension,
A, Fig. 175, midway between two
horizontal glass rods, <i>a b</i>, <i>a′ b′</i>, supported
firmly at their ends, and about
an inch asunder. The rods cross the
wire at a height of 7 feet above the
bob of the pendulum. The whole
length of the pendulum being 28 feet,
the glass rods intercept one-fourth of
this length. On drawing the pendulum aside in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>direction of the rods, <i>a b</i>, <i>a′ b′</i>, and letting it go, it
oscillates freely between them. I bring it to rest and
draw it aside in a direction perpendicular to the last; a
length of 7 feet only can now oscillate, and by the laws
of oscillation a pendulum 7 feet long vibrates with twice
the rapidity of a pendulum 28 feet long.</p>

<p>I wish to show you the figure described by the combination
of these two rates of vibration. Attached to the
copper ball, <i>p</i>, is a camel’s-hair pencil, intended to rub
lightly upon a glass plate placed on black paper and over
which is strewed white sand. Allowing the pendulum to
oscillate as a whole, the sand is rubbed away along a
straight line which represents the amplitude of the vibration.
Let <i>a b</i>, Fig. 176, represent this line, which, as
before, we will assume to be described in one second.
When the pendulum is at the limit, <i>b</i>, of its swing, let
a rectangular impulse be imparted to it sufficient to carry
it to <i>c</i> in one-fourth of a second. If this were the only
impulse acting on the pendulum, the bob would reach <i>c</i>
and return to <i>b</i> in half a second. But under the actual
circumstances it is also urged toward <i>d</i>, which point,
through the vibration of the whole pendulum, it ought
also to reach in half a second. Both vibrations, therefore,
require that the bob shall reach <i>d</i> at the same moment;
and to do this it will have to describe the curve
<i>b c′ d</i>. Again, in the time required by the long pendulum
to pass from <i>d</i> to <i>a</i>, the short pendulum will pass
<em>to and fro</em> over the half of its excursion; both vibrations
must therefore reach <i>a</i> at the same moment, and to accomplish
this the pendulum describes the lower curve
between <i>d</i> and <i>a</i>. It is manifest that these two curves
will repeat themselves at the opposite sides of <i>a b</i>, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
combination of both vibrations producing finally a figure
of 8, which you now see fairly drawn upon the sand
before you.</p>

<p>The same figure is obtained if the rectangular impulse
be imparted when the pendulum is passing its position of
rest, <i>d</i>.</p>

<p>I have here supposed the time occupied by the pendulum
in describing the line <i>a b</i> to be one second. Let
us suppose three-fourths of the second exhausted, and the
pendulum at <i>d′</i>, Fig. 177, in its excursion toward <i>b</i>; let
the rectangular impulse then be imparted to it, sufficient
to carry it to <i>c</i> in one-fourth of a second. Now the long
pendulum requires that it should move from <i>d′</i> to <i>b</i> in
one-fourth of a second; both impulses are therefore satisfied
by the pendulum taking up the position <i>c′</i> at the
end of a quarter of a second. To reach this position it
must describe the curve <i>d′ c′</i>. It will manifestly return
along the same curve, and at the end of another quarter
of a second find itself again at <i>d′</i>. From <i>d′</i> to <i>d</i> the long
pendulum requires a quarter of a second. But at the
end of this time the short pendulum must be at the
lower limit of its swing: both requirements are satisfied
by the pendulum being at <i>e</i>. We thus obtain one arm,
<i>c′ e</i>, of a curve, which repeats itself to the left of <i>e</i>; so
that the entire curve, due to the combination of the two
vibrations, is that represented in <a href="#f165">Fig. 165</a>. This figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
is a parabola, whereas the figure of 8 before obtained
is a lemniscata.</p>

<p>We have here supposed that, at the moment when the
rectangular impulse was applied, the motion of the pendulum
was <em>toward</em> <i>b</i>: if it were toward <i>a</i> we should obtain
the inverted parabola, as shown in <a href="#f178">Fig. 178</a>.</p>

<p>Supposing, finally, the impulse to be applied, not
when the pendulum is passing through its position of
equilibrium, nor when it is passing a point corresponding
to three-fourths or one-fourth of the time of its excursion,
but at some other point in the line, <i>a b</i>, between
its end and centre. Under these circumstances we should
have neither the parabola nor the perfectly symmetrical
figure of 8, but a distorted 8.</p>

<p>And now we are prepared to witness with profit the
combined vibration of our two tuning-forks, one of which
sounds the octave of the other. Permitting the vertical
fork, <span class="smcap">T</span>, <a href="#f172">Fig. 172</a>, to remain undisturbed in front of the
lamp, we can oppose to it a horizontal fork, which vibrates
with twice the rapidity. The first passage of the
bow across the two forks reveals the exact similarity of
this combination, and that of our pendulum. A very
perfect figure of 8 is described upon the screen. Before
the lecture the vibrations of these two forks were fixed
as nearly as possible to the ratio of 1:2, and the steadiness
of the figure indicates the perfection of the tuning.
Stopping both forks, and again agitating them, we have
the distorted 8 upon the screen. A few trials enable me
to bring out the parabola. In all these cases the figure
remains fixed upon the screen. But if a morsel of wax
be attached to one of the forks, the figure is steady no
longer, but passes from the perfect 8 into the distorted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
one, thence into the parabola, from which it afterward
opens out to an 8 once more. By augmenting the discord,
we can render those changes as rapid as we please.</p>

<p>When the 8 is steady on the screen, a rotation of the
mirror of the fork, <span class="smcap">T</span>, produces the scroll shown in
Fig. 179.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 179.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Our next combination will be that of two forks
vibrating in the ratio of 2:3. Observe the admirable
steadiness of the figure produced by the compounding
of these two rates of vibration. On attaching a four-penny-piece
with wax to one of the forks the steadiness
ceases, and we have an apparent rocking to and fro
of the luminous figure. Passing on to intervals of 3:4,
4:5, and 5:6, the figures become more intricate as we
proceed. The last combination, 5:6, is so entangled
that to see the figure plainly a very narrow band of
light must be employed. The distance existing between
the forks and the screen also helps us to unravel the
complication.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 180.</span></div>
</div>

<p>And here it is worth noting that, when the figure is
fully developed, the loops along the vertical and horizontal
edges express the ratio of the combined vibrations.
In the octave, for example, we have two loops
in one direction, and one in another; in the fifth, two
loops in one direction, and three in another. When
the combination is as 1:3, the luminous loops are also
as 1:3. The changes which some of these figures un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a><br /><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>dergo,
when the tuning is not perfect, are extremely
remarkable. In the case of 1:3, for example, it is
difficult at times not to believe that you are looking
at a solid link of white-hot metal. The figure exhibits
a depth, apparently incompatible with its being traced
upon a plane surface.</p>

all of these each figure passes

forks is not pure. I also add here, Fig. 181, two phases
of the combination 8:9.</p>

<p>But the most instructive apparatus for the compounding
of rectangular vibrations is that of Mr. Tisley. Figs.
184 and 185 are copies of figures obtained by him through
the joint action of two distinct pendulums; the rates of
vibration corresponding to these particular figures being
2:3 and 3:4 respectively. The pen which traces the
figures is moved simultaneously by two rods attached to
the pendulums above their places of suspension. These
two rods lie in the two planes of vibration, being at
right angles to the pendulums, and to each other. At
their place of intersection is the pen. By means of a
ball and socket, of a special kind, the rods are enabled
to move with a minimum of friction in all directions,
while the rates of vibration are altered, in a moment, by
the shifting of movable weights. The figures are drawn
either with ink on paper, or, when projection on a screen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span>
is desired, by a sharp point on smoked glass. When the
pendulums, having gone through the entire figure, return
to their starting-point, they have lost a little in amplitude.
The second excursion will, therefore, be smaller
than the first, and the third smaller than the second.
Hence the series of fine lines, inclosing gradually-diminishing
areas, shown in these exquisite figures.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> Mr. Tisley’s

<p>Sir Charles Wheatstone devised, many years ago, a
small and very efficient apparatus for the compounding
of rectangular vibrations. A drawing, Fig. 186, and a
description of this beautiful little instrument, for both of
which I am indebted to its eminent inventor, may find
a place here: <i>a</i> is a steel rod polished at its upper end
so as to reflect a point of light; this rod moves in a ball-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>and-socket
joint at <i>b</i>, so that it may assume any position.
Its lower end is connected with two arms <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>, placed
at right angles to each other, the other ends of which
are respectively attached to the circumferences of the two
circular disks <i>e</i> and <i>f</i>. The axis of the disk <i>e</i> carries at
its opposite end another large disk <i>g</i>, which gives motion
to the small disk <i>h</i>, placed on the axis which carries the
disk <i>f</i>; and, according as this small disk <i>h</i> is placed
nearer to or further from the centre of the disk <i>g</i>, it communicates
a different relative motion to the disk <i>f</i>. The
nut and screw <i>i</i> enable the disk <i>h</i> to be placed in any
position between the centre, and circumference of the
larger disk <i>g</i>; and by means of the fork <i>j</i> the disk <i>f</i> is
caused to revolve, whatever may be the position of the
disk <i>h</i>. By this arrangement, while the wheel <i>k</i> is turned
regularly, the rod <i>a</i> is moved backward and forward by
the disk <i>e</i> in one direction, and by the disk <i>f</i>, with any
relative oscillatory motion, in the rectangular direction.
The end of the rod is thus made to describe and to exhibit
optically all the beautiful acoustical figures produced
by the composition of vibrations of different
periods in directions rectangular to each other. A lever
<i>l</i>, bearing against the nut <i>i</i>, indicates, on a scale <i>m</i>, the
numerical ratio of the two vibrations.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></p>

<p>I close these remarks on the combination of rectangular
vibrations with a brief reference to an apparatus
constructed by Mr. A. E. Donkin, of Exeter College, Oxford,
and described in the “Proceedings of the Royal
Society,” vol. xxii., p. 196. In its construction great
mechanical knowledge is associated with consummate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span>skill. I saw the apparatus as a wooden model, before
it quitted the hands of its inventor, and was charmed
with its performance. It is now constructed by Messrs.
Tisley and Spiller.</p>


<h3>SUMMARY OF CHAPTER IX</h3>

<p>By the division of a string Pythagoras determined
the consonant intervals in music, proving that, the simpler
the ratio of the two parts into which the string was
divided, the more perfect is the harmony of the sounds
emitted by the two parts of the string. Subsequent investigators
showed that the strings act thus because of
the relation of their lengths to their rates of vibration.</p>

<p>With the double siren this law of consonance is
readily illustrated. Here the most perfect harmony is
the unison, where the vibrations are in the ratio of 1:1.
Next comes the octave, where the vibrations are in the
ratio of 1:2. Afterward follow in succession the fifth,
with a ratio of 2:3; the fourth, with a ratio of 3:4; the
major third, with a ratio of 4:5; and the minor third,
with a ratio of 5:6. The interval of a tone, represented
by the ratio 8:9, is dissonant, while that of a semitone,
with a ratio of 15:16, is a harsh and grating dissonance.</p>

<p>The musical interval is independent of the absolute
number of the vibrations of the two notes, depending
only on the <em>ratio</em> of the two rates of vibration.</p>

<p>The Pythagoreans referred the pleasing effect of the
consonant intervals to number and harmony, and connected
them with “the music of the spheres.” Euler
explained the consonant intervals by reference to the
constitution of the mind, which, he affirmed, took pleas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span>ure
in simple calculations. The mind was fond of order,
but of such order as involved no weariness in its contemplation.
This pleasure was afforded by the simpler
ratios in the case of music.</p>

<p>The researches of Helmholtz prove the rapid succession
of beats to be the real cause of dissonance in music.</p>

<p>By means of two singing-flames, the pitch of one of
them being changeable by the telescopic lengthening
of its tube, beats of any degree of slowness or rapidity
may be produced. Commencing with beats slow enough
to be counted, and gradually increasing their rapidity,
we reach, without breach of continuity, downright dissonance.</p>

<p>But, to grasp this theory in all its completeness, we
must refer to the constitution of the human ear. We
have first the tympanic membrane, which is the anterior
boundary of the drum of the ear. Across the drum
stretches a series of little bones, called respectively the
<em>hammer</em>, the <em>anvil</em>, and the <em>stirrup-bone</em>; the latter abutting
against a second membrane, which forms part of the
posterior boundary of the drum. Beyond this membrane
is the labyrinth filled with water, and having its lining
membrane covered with the filaments of the auditory
nerve.</p>

<p>Every shock received by the tympanic membrane is
transmitted through the series of bones to the opposite
membrane; thence to the water of the labyrinth, and
thence to the auditory nerve.</p>

<p>The transmission is not direct. The vibrations are in
the first place taken up by certain bodies, which can
swing sympathetically with them. These bodies are of
three kinds: the otolites, which are little crystalline par<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span>ticles;
the bristles of Max Schultze; and the fibres of
Corti’s organ. This latter is to all intents and purposes
a stringed instrument, of extraordinary complexity and
perfection, placed within the ear.</p>

<p>As regards our present subject, the strings of Corti’s
organ probably play an especially important part. That
one string should respond, in some measure, to another,
it is not necessary that the unison should be perfect; a
certain degree of response occurs in the immediate neighborhood
of unison.</p>

<p>Hence each of two strings, not far removed from
each other in pitch, can cause a third string, of intermediate
pitch, to respond sympathetically. And if the two
strings be sounded together, the beats which they produce
are propagated to the intermediate string.</p>

<p>So, as regards Corti’s organ, when single sounds of
various pitches, or rather when vibrations of various rapidities,
fall upon its strings, the vibrations are responded
to by the particular string whose period coincides with
theirs. And when two sounds, close to each other in
pitch, produce beats, the intermediate Corti’s fibre is
acted on by both, and responds to the beats.</p>

<p>In the middle and upper portions of the musical scale
the beats are most grating and harsh when they succeed
each other at the rate of 33 per second. When they
occur at the rate of 132 per second, they cease to be
sensible.</p>

<p>The perfect consonance of certain musical intervals is
due to the absence of beats. The imperfect consonance
of other intervals is due to their existence. And here
the overtones play a part of the utmost importance. For,
though the primaries may sound together without any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span>
perceptible roughness, the overtones may be so related to
each other as to produce harsh and grating beats. A
strict analysis of the subject proves that intervals which
require large numbers to express them are invariably
accompanied by overtones which produce beats; while
in intervals expressed by small numbers the beats are
practically absent.</p>

<p>The graphic representation of the consonances and
dissonances of the musical scale, by Helmholtz, furnishes
a striking proof of this explanation.</p>

<p>The optical illustration of the musical intervals has
been effected in a very beautiful manner by Lissajous.
Corresponding to each interval is a definite figure, produced
by the combination of its vibrations.</p>

<p>The compounding of vibrations has, of late years, been
beautifully illustrated by apparatus constructed by Sir C.
Wheatstone, Mr. Herbert Airy, and Mr. A. E. Donkin;
and by the beautiful pendulum apparatus of Mr. Tisley,
of the firm of Tisley and Spiller.</p>



<p class="tb">The pressure which, on a former occasion, prevented
me from adding a “summary” to this chapter, was also
the cause of hastiness, and partial inaccuracy, in its
sketch of the theory of Helmholtz. That the sketch
needed emendation I have long known, but I did not
think it worth while to anticipate the correction here
made; as the chapter, imperfect as it was, had been published,
without comment, in Germany, by Helmholtz
himself.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX I</h3>

<p class="center">ON THE INFLUENCE OF MUSICAL SOUNDS ON THE FLAME
OF A JET OF COAL-GAS.  BY JOHN LE CONTE, M.D.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>


<p>A short time after reading Prof. John Tyndall’s excellent
article “On the Sounds produced by the Combustion of
Gases in Tubes,”<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> I happened to be one of a party of eight
persons assembled after tea for the purpose of enjoying a
private musical entertainment. Three instruments were employed
in the performance of several of the grand trios of
Beethoven, namely, the piano, violin, and violoncello. Two
“<em>fish-tail</em>” gas-burners projected from the brick wall near
the piano. Both of them burned with remarkable steadiness,
the windows being closed and the air of the room being
very calm. Nevertheless, it was evident that <em>one</em> of them
was under a pressure nearly sufficient to make it <em>flare</em>.</p>

<p>Soon after the music commenced, I observed that the
flame of the last-mentioned burner exhibited pulsations in
height which were <em>exactly synchronous</em> with the audible
beats. This phenomenon was very striking to every one in
the room, and especially so when the strong notes of the
violoncello came in. It was exceedingly interesting to observe
how perfectly even the <em>trills</em> of this instrument were
reflected on the sheet of flame. <em>A deaf man might have seen</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span>
<em>the harmony</em>. As the evening advanced, and the diminished
consumption of gas in the city <em>increased the pressure</em>, the
phenomenon became more conspicuous. The <em>jumping</em> of
the flame gradually increased, became somewhat irregular,
and finally it began to flare continuously, emitting the characteristic
sound indicating the escape of a greater amount of
gas than could be properly consumed. I then ascertained
by experiment that the phenomenon <em>did not</em> take place
unless the discharge of gas was so regulated that the flame
approximated to the condition of <em>flaring</em>. I likewise determined
by experiment that the effects <em>were not</em> produced by
jarring or shaking the floor and walls of the room by means
of repeated concussions. Hence it is obvious that the pulsations
of the flame <em>were not</em> owing to <em>indirect</em> vibrations
propagated through the medium of the walls of the room to
the burning apparatus, but must have been produced by the
<em>direct</em> influence of the aërial sonorous pulses on the burning
jet.</p>

<p>In the experiments of M. Schaffgotsch and Prof. J.
Tyndall, it is evident that “the shaking of the singing-flame
within the glass tube,” produced by the voice or the
siren, was a phenomenon perfectly analogous to what took
place under my observation <em>without the intervention of a tube</em>.
In my case the discharge of gas was so regulated that there
was a tendency in the flame to flare, or to emit a “<em>singing-sound</em>.”
Under these circumstances, strong aërial pulsations
occurring at <em>regular intervals</em> were sufficient to develop synchronous
fluctuations in the height of the flame. It is probable
that the effects would be more striking when the tones
of the musical instrument are <em>nearly</em> in unison with the
sounds which would be produced by the flame under the
slight increase in the rapidity of discharge of gas required
to manifest the phenomenon of flaring. This point might
be submitted to an experimental test.</p>

<p>As in Prof. Tyndall’s experiments on the jet of gas burning
within a tube, clapping of the hands, shouting, etc., were
ineffectual in converting the “silent” into the “singing-flame,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>
so, in the case under consideration, <em>irregular</em> sounds
did not produce any perceptible influence. It seems to be
necessary that the impulses should <em>accumulate</em>, in order to
exercise an appreciable effect.</p>

<p>With regard to the mode in which the sounds are produced
by the combustion of gases in tubes, it is universally
admitted that the explanation given by Prof. Faraday in
1818 is essentially correct. It is well known that he referred
these sounds to the successive explosions produced by the
periodic combination of the atmospheric oxygen with the issuing
jet of gas. While reading Prof. J. Plateau’s admirable
researches (third series) on the “Theory of the Modifications
experienced by Jets of Liquid issuing from Circular Orifices
when exposed to the Influence of Vibratory Motions,”<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> the
idea flashed across my mind that the phenomenon which
had fallen under my observation was nothing more than a
<em>particular case</em> of the effects of sounds on <em>all kinds of fluid
jets</em>. Subsequent reflection has only served to fortify this
first impression.</p>

<p>The beautiful investigations of Felix Savart, on the influence
of sounds on jets of water, afford results presenting
so many points of analogy with their effects on the jet of
burning gas, that it may be well to inquire whether both of
them may be referred to a common cause. In order to place
this in a striking light, I shall subjoin some of the results of
Savart’s experiments. Vertically-descending jets of water
receive the following modifications under the influence of
vibrations:</p>

<p>1. The continuous portions become shortened; the vein
resolves itself into separate drops nearer the orifice than
when <em>not</em> under the influence of vibrations.</p>

<p>2. Each of the masses, as they detach themselves from
the extremity of the continuous part, becomes flattened
alternately in a vertical and horizontal direction, presenting
to the eye, under the influence of their translatory motion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>
regularly-disposed series of maxima and minima of thickness,
or ventral segments and nodes.</p>

<p>3. The foregoing modifications become much more developed
and regular when a note, in unison with that which
would be produced by the shock of the discontinuous part
of the jet against a stretched membrane, is sounded in its
neighborhood. The continuous part becomes considerably
shortened, and the ventral segments are enlarged.</p>

<p>4. When the note of the instrument is <em>almost</em> in unison,
the continuous part of the jet is alternately lengthened and
shortened and the beats which coincide with these variations
in length <em>can be recognized by the ear</em>.</p>

<p>5. Other tones act with less energy on the jet, and some
produce no sensible effect.</p>

<p>When a jet is made to ascend <em>obliquely</em>, so that the discontinuous
part appears scattered into a kind of <em>sheaf</em> in the
same vertical plane, M. Savart found:</p>

<p><i>a.</i> That, under the influence of vibrations of a determinate
period, this sheaf may form itself into <em>two</em> distinct jets,
each possessing regularly-disposed ventral segments and
nodes; sometimes with a different node the sheaf becomes
replaced by <em>three</em> jets.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> The note which produces the greatest shortening of
the continuous part always reduces the whole to a <em>single</em> jet,
presenting a perfectly regular system of ventral segments
and nodes.</p>

<p>In the last memoir of M. Savart—a posthumous one,
presented to the Academy of Sciences of Paris, by M.
Arago, in 1853<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a>—several remarkable acoustic phenomena
are noticed in relation to the musical tones produced by the
efflux of liquids through short tubes. When certain precautions
and conditions are observed (which are minutely
detailed by this able experimentalist), the discharge of the
liquid gives rise to a succession of musical tones of great
intensity and of a peculiar quality, somewhat analogous to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span>that of the human voice. That these notes were not produced
by the descending drops of the liquid vein was proved
by permitting it to discharge itself into a vessel of water,
while the orifice was below the surface of the latter. In this
case the jet of liquid must have been <em>continuous</em>, but nevertheless
the notes were produced. These unexpected results
have been entirely confirmed by the more recent experiments
of Prof. Tyndall.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></p>

<p>According to the researches of M. Plateau, all the phenomena
of the influence of vibrations on jets of liquid are
referable to the conflict between the vibrations and the
<em>forces of figure</em> (“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">forces figuratrices</em>”). If the physical fact
is admitted—and it seems to be indisputable—that a liquid
cylinder attains a <em>limit of stability</em> when the proportion between
its length and its diameter is in the ratio of twenty-two
to seven, it is almost a <em>physical necessity</em> that the jet
should assume the constitution indicated by the observations
of Savart. It likewise seems highly probable that a
liquid jet, while in a transition stage to discontinuous drops,
should be exceedingly sensitive to the influence of all kinds
of vibrations. It must be confessed, however, that Plateau’s
beautiful and coherent theory does not appear to embrace
Savart’s last experiment, in which the musical tones were
produced by a jet of water issuing under the surface of the
same liquid. It is rather difficult to imagine what agency
the “forces of figure” could have, under such circumstances,
in the production of the phenomenon. This curious experiment
tends to corroborate Savart’s original idea, that the
vibrations which produce the sounds must take place in
the glass reservoir itself, and that the cause must be inherent
in the phenomenon of the flow.</p>

<p>To apply the principles of Plateau’s theory to gaseous
jets, we are compelled to abandon the idea of the <em>non-existence
of molecular cohesion in gases</em>. But is there not
abundant evidence to show that cohesion <em>does exist</em> among
the particles of gaseous masses? Does not the deviation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">459</a></span>from rigorous accuracy, both in the law of Mariotte and
Gay-Lussac—especially in the case of condensable gases,
as shown by the admirable experiments of M. Regnault—clearly
prove that the hypothesis of the non-existence of
cohesion in aëriform bodies is fallacious? Do not the expanding
rings which ascend when a bubble of phosphuretted
hydrogen takes fire in the air indicate the existence of some
cohesive force in the gaseous product of combustion (aqueous
vapor), whose outlines are marked by the opaque phosphoric
acid? In short, does not the very <em>form</em> of the flame
of a “fish-tail” burner demonstrate that cohesion <em>must exist</em>
among the particles of the issuing gas? It is well known
that in this burner the single jet which issues is formed by
the union of <em>two oblique jets</em> immediately before the gas is
emitted. The result is a perpendicular <em>sheet of flame</em>. How
is such a result produced by the mutual action of two jets,
unless the force of cohesion is brought into play? Is it not
obvious that such a fanlike flame must be produced by the
same causes as those varied and beautiful forms of aqueous
sheets, developed by the mutual action of jets of water, so
strikingly exhibited in the experiments of Savart and of
Magnus?</p>

<p>If it be granted that gases possess molecular cohesion, it
seems to be physically certain that jets of gas must be subject
to the same laws as those of liquid. Vibratory movements
excited in the neighborhood ought, therefore, to
produce modifications in them analogous to those recorded
by M. Savart in relation to jets of water. Flame or incandescent
gas presents gaseous matter in a <em>visible</em> form, admirably
adapted for experimental investigation; and, <em>when
produced by a jet</em>, should be amenable to the principles of
Plateau’s theory. According to this view, the pulsations
or <em>beats</em> which I observed in the gas-flame when under the
influence of musical sounds, are produced by the conflict
between the aërial vibrations and the “forces of figure” (as
Plateau calls them) giving origin to periodical fluctuations
of intensity, depending on the sonorous pulses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">460</a></span></p>

<p>If this view is correct, will it not be necessary for us
to modify our ideas in relation to the agency of tubes in
developing musical sounds by means of burning jets of gas?
Must we not look upon all burning jets—as in the case of
water-jets—as <em>musically inclined</em>; and that the use of tubes
merely places them in a condition favorable for developing
the tones? It is well known that burning jets frequently
emit a <em>singing-sound</em> when they are perfectly <em>free</em>. Are
these sounds produced by successive explosions analogous
to those which take place in glass tubes? It is very certain
that, under the influence of molecular forces, any cause
which tends to elongate the flame, without affecting the
velocity of discharge, must tend to render it discontinuous,
and thus bring about that mixture of gas and air which is
essential to the production of the explosions. The influence
of tubes, as well as of aërial vibrations, in establishing this
condition of things, is sufficiently obvious. Was not the
“beaded line” with its succession of “luminous stars,”
which Prof. Tyndall observed when a flame of olefiant gas,
burning in a tube, was examined by means of a moving
mirror, an indication that the flame became <em>discontinuous</em>,
precisely as the continuous part of a jet of water becomes
<em>shortened</em>, and resolved into isolated drops, under the influence
of sonorous pulsations? But I forbear enlarging on
this very interesting subject, inasmuch as the accomplished
physicist last named has promised to examine it at a future
period. In the hands of so sagacious a philosopher, we may
anticipate a most searching investigation of the phenomena
in all their relations. In the meantime I wish to call the
attention of men of science to the view presented in this
article, in so far as it groups together several classes of
phenomena under one head, and may be considered a partial
generalization.—From Silliman’s “American Journal” for
January, 1858.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX II</h3>

<p class="center f08">ON ACOUSTIC REVERSIBILITY<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>


<p>On the 21st and 22d of June, 1822, a commission, appointed
by the Bureau des Longitudes of France, executed
a celebrated series of experiments on the velocity of sound.
Two stations had been chosen, the one at Villejuif, the other
at Montlhéry, both lying south of Paris, and 11·6 miles distant
from each other. Prony, Mathieu, and Arago were the
observers at Villejuif, while Humboldt, Bouvard, and Gay-Lussac
were at Montlhéry. Guns, charged sometimes with
two pounds and sometimes with three pounds of powder,
were fired at both stations, and the velocity was deduced
from the interval between the appearance of the flash and
the arrival of the sound.</p>

<p>On this memorable occasion an observation was made
which, as far as I know, has remained a scientific enigma
to the present hour. It was noticed that while every report
of the cannon fired at Montlhéry was heard with the greatest
distinctness at Villejuif, by far the greater number of
the reports from Villejuif failed to reach Montlhéry. Had
wind existed, and had it blown from Montlhéry to Villejuif,
it would have been recognized as the cause of the observed
difference; but the air at the time was calm, the slight motion
of translation actually existing being from Villejuif toward
Montlhéry, or against the direction in which the sound
was best heard.</p>

<p>So marked was the difference in transmissive power between
the two directions, that on June 22d, while every shot
fired at Montlhéry was heard <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à merveille</em> at Villejuif, but
one shot out of twelve fired at Villejuif was heard, and that
feebly, at the other station.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span></p>
<p>With the caution which characterized him on other occasions,
and which has been referred to admiringly by Faraday,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a>
Arago made no attempt to explain this anomaly. His
words are: “Quant aux différences si remarquables d’intensité
que le bruit du canon a toujours présentées suivant
qu’il se propageait du nord au sud entre Villejuif et Montlhéry,
ou du sud au nord entre cette seconde station et la
première, nous ne chercherons pas aujourd’hui à l’expliquer,
parce que nous ne pourrions offrir au lecteur que des conjectures
denuées de preuves.”<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></p>

<p>I have tried, after much perplexity of thought, to bring
this subject within the range of experiment, and have now
to submit the following solution of the enigma: The first
step was to ascertain whether the sensitive flame, referred
to in my recent paper in the “Philosophical Transactions,”
could be safely employed in experiments on the mutual reversibility
of a source of sound and an object on which
the sound impinges. Now, the sensitive flame usually employed
by me measures from eighteen to twenty-four inches
in height, while the reed employed as a source of sound is
less than a square quarter of an inch in area. If, therefore,
the whole flame, or the pipe which fed it, were sensitive to
sonorous vibrations, strict experiments on reversibility with
the reed and flame might be difficult, if not impossible.
Hence my desire to learn whether the seat of sensitiveness
was so localized in the flame as to render the contemplated
interchange of flame and reed permissible.</p>

<p>The flame being placed behind a cardboard screen, the
shank of a funnel passed through a hole in the cardboard
was directed upon the middle of the flame. The sound-waves
issuing from the vibrating reed, placed within the
funnel, produced no sensible effect upon the flame. Shifting
the funnel so as to direct its shank upon the root of the
flame, the action was violent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span></p>

<p>To augment the precision of the experiment, the funnel
was connected with a glass tube three feet long and half an
inch in diameter, the object being to weaken, by distance,
the effect of the waves diffracted round the edge of the funnel,
and to permit those only which passed through the glass
tube to act upon the flame.</p>

<p>Presenting the end of the tube to the orifice of the burner
(<i>b</i>, Fig. 1), or the orifice to the end of the tube, the flame was
violently agitated by the sounding-reed, <span class="smcap">R</span>. On shifting the
tube, or the burner, so as to concentrate the sound on a portion
of the flame about half an inch above the orifice, the
action was <em>nil</em>. Concentrating the sound upon the burner
itself, about half an inch below its orifice, there was no
action.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_463.jpg" width="450" height="164" alt="Fig. 1." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span></div></div>

<p>These experiments demonstrate the localization of “the
seat of sensitiveness,” and they prove the flame to be an
appropriate instrument for the contemplated experiments
on reversibility.</p>

<p>The experiments then proceeded thus: The sensitive
flame being placed close behind a screen of cardboard 18
inches high by 12 inches wide, a vibrating reed, standing
at the same height as the root of the flame, was placed at
a distance of 6 feet on the other side of the screen. The
sound of the reed, in this position, produced a strong agitation
of the flame.</p>

<p>The whole upper half of the flame was here visible from
the reed; hence the necessity of the foregoing experiments
to prove the action of the sound on the upper portion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span>
flame to be <em>nil</em>, and that the waves had really to bend round
the edge of the screen, so as to reach the seat of sensitiveness
in the neighborhood of the burner.</p>

<p>The positions of the flame and reed were reversed, the
latter being now close behind the screen, and the former at
a distance of 6 feet from it. The sonorous vibrations were
without sensible action upon the flame.</p>

<p>The experiment was repeated and varied in many ways.
Screens of various sizes were employed; and, instead of reversing
the positions of the flame and reed, the screen itself
was moved, so as to bring in some experiments the flame,
and in other experiments the reed, close behind it. Care
was also taken that no reflected sound from the walls or
ceiling of the laboratory, or from the body of the experimenter,
should have anything to do with the effect. In all
cases it was shown that the sound was effective when the
reed was at a distance from the screen, and the flame close
behind it; while the action was insensible when these positions
were reversed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_464.jpg" width="300" height="110" alt="Fig. 2." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Thus, let <i>s e</i>, Fig. 2, be a vertical section of the screen.
When the reed was at A and the flame at B there was no
action; when the reed was at B and the flame at A the action
was decided. It may be added that the vibrations communicated
to the screen itself, and from it to the air beyond
it, were without effect; for when the reed, which at B was
effectual, was shifted to C, where its action on the screen
was greatly augmented, it ceased to have any action on the
flame at A.</p>

<p>We are now, I think, prepared to consider the failure
of reversibility in the larger experiments of 1822. Happily
an incidental observation of great significance comes here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">465</a></span>
to our aid. It was observed and recorded at the time that,
while the reports of the guns at Villejuif were without
echoes, a roll of echoes lasting from 20 to 25 seconds accompanied
every shot at Montlhéry, being heard by the
observers there. Arago, the writer of the report, referred
these echoes to reflection from the clouds, an explanation
which I think we are now entitled to regard as problematical.
The report says that “tous les coups tirés à Montlhéry
y étaient <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">accompagnés</em> d’un roulement semblable à celui du
tonnerre.” I have italicized a very significant word—a
word which fairly applies to our experiments on gun-sounds
at the South Foreland, where there was no sensible interval
between explosion and echo, but which could hardly apply
to echoes coming from the clouds. For supposing the clouds
to be only a mile distant, the sound and its echo would have
been separated by an interval of nearly ten seconds. But
there is no mention of any interval; and, had such existed,
surely the word “followed,” instead of “accompanied,”
would have been the one employed. The echoes, moreover,
appear to have been <em>continuous</em>, while the clouds observed
seem to have been <em>separate</em>. “Ces phénomènes,”
says Arago, “n’ont jamais eu lieu qu’au moment de l’apparition
de quelques nuages.” But from separate clouds a continuous
roll of echoes could hardly come. When to this is
added the experimental fact that clouds far denser than any
ever formed in the atmosphere are demonstrably incapable
of sensibly reflecting sound, while cloudless air, which
Arago pronounced echoless, has been proved capable of
powerfully reflecting it, I think we have strong reason
to question the hypothesis of the illustrious French philosopher.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></p>

<p>And, considering the hundreds of shots fired at the
South Foreland, with the attention especially directed to
the aërial echoes, when no single case occurred in which
echoes of measurable duration did not accompany the report
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">466</a></span>of the gun, I think Arago’s statement, that at Villejuif no
echoes were heard when the sky was clear, must simply
mean that they vanished with great rapidity. Unless the
attention was specially directed to the point, a slight prolongation
of the cannon-sound might well escape observation;
and it would be all the more likely to do so if the
echoes were so loud and prompt as to form apparently part
and parcel of the direct sound.</p>

<p>I should be very loth to transgress here the limits of
fair criticism, or to throw doubt, without good reason, on
the recorded observations of illustrious men. Still, taking
into account what has been just stated, and remembering
that the minds of Arago and his colleagues were occupied
by a totally different problem (that the echoes were an incident
rather than an object of observation), I think we may
justly consider the sound which he called “instantaneous”
as one whose aërial echoes did not differentiate themselves
from the direct sound by any noticeable fall of intensity,
and which rapidly died into silence.</p>

<p>Turning now to the observations at Montlhéry, we are
struck by the extraordinary duration of the echoes heard at
that station. At the South Foreland the charge habitually
fired was equal to the largest of those employed by the
French philosophers; but on no occasion did the gun-sounds
produce echoes approaching to 20 or 25 seconds’ duration.
The time rarely reached half this amount. Even the siren-echoes,
which were more remarkable and more long-continued
than those of the gun, never reached the duration of
the Montlhéry echoes. The nearest approach to it was on
October 17, 1873, when the siren-echoes required 15 seconds
to subside into silence.</p>

<p>On this same day, moreover (and this is a point of
marked significance), the transmitted sound reached its
maximum range, the gun-sounds being heard at the Quenocs
buoy, 16-1/2 nautical miles from the South Foreland. I
have stated in another place that the duration of the air-echoes
indicates “the atmospheric depths” from which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">467</a></span>
came. An optical analogy may help us here. Let light fall
upon chalk, the light is wholly scattered by the superficial
particles; let the chalk be powdered and mixed with water,
light reaches the observer from a far greater depth of the
turbid liquid. The solid chalk typifies the action of exceedingly
dense acoustic clouds; the chalk and water that
of clouds of more moderate density. In the one case we
have echoes of short, in the other echoes of long, duration.
These considerations prepare us for the inference that
Montlhéry, on the occasion referred to, must have been
surrounded by a highly-diacoustic atmosphere; while the
shortness of the echoes at Villejuif shows that the atmosphere
surrounding that station must have been, in a high
degree, acoustically opaque.</p>

<p>Have we any clew to the cause of the opacity? I think
we have. Villejuif is close to Paris, and over it, with the
observed light wind, was slowly wafted the air from the
city. Thousands of chimneys to windward of Villejuif were
discharging their heated currents; so that an exceeding non-homogeneous
atmosphere must have surrounded that station.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a>
At no great height in the atmosphere the equilibrium
of temperature would be established. This non-homogeneous
air surrounding Villejuif is experimentally typified by
our screen, with the source of sound close behind it, the
upper edge of the screen representing the place where
equilibrium of temperature was established in the atmosphere
above the station. In virtue of its proximity to the
screen, the echoes from our sounding-reed would, in the
case here supposed, so blend with the direct sound as to be
practically indistinguishable from it, as the echoes at Villejuif
followed the direct sound so hotly, and vanished so
rapidly, that they escaped observation. And as our sensitive
flame, at a distance, failed to be affected by the sounding
body placed close behind the cardboard screen, so, I
take it, did the observers at Montlhéry fail to hear the
sounds of the Villejuif gun.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span></p>
<p>Something further may be done toward the experimental
elucidation of this subject. The facility with which sounds
pass through textile fabrics has been already illustrated,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> a
layer of cambric or calico, or even of thick flannel or baize,
being found competent to intercept but a small fraction of
the sound from a vibrating reed. Such a layer of calico
may be taken to represent a layer of air, differentiated from
its neighbors by temperature or moisture; while a succession
of such sheets of calico may be taken to represent
successive layers of non-homogeneous air.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_468.jpg" width="500" height="176" alt="Fig. 3." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Two tin tubes (M N and O P, Fig. 3) with open ends
were placed so as to form an acute angle with each other.
At the end of one was the vibrating reed <i>r</i>; opposite the
end of the other, and in the prolongation of P O, the sensitive
flame <i>f</i>, a second sensitive flame (<i>f′</i>) being placed in
the continuation of the axis of M N. On sounding the
reed, the direct sound through M N agitated the flame <i>f′</i>.
Introducing the square of calico <i>a b</i> at the proper angle, a
slight decrease of the action on <i>f′</i> was noticed, and the
feeble echo from <i>a b</i> produced a barely perceptible agitation
of the flame f. Adding another square, <i>c d</i>, the sound
transmitted by <i>a b</i> impinged on <i>c d</i>; it was partially echoed,
returned through <i>a b</i>, passed along P O, and still further
agitated the flame <i>f</i>. Adding a third square, <i>e f</i>, the reflected
sound was still further augmented, every accession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">469</a></span>to the echo being accompanied by a corresponding withdrawal
of the vibrations from <i>f′</i>, and a consequent stilling
of that flame.</p>

<p>With thinner calico or cambric it would require a greater
number of layers to intercept the entire sound; hence with
such cambric we should have echoes returned from a greater
distance, and therefore of greater duration. Eight layers of
the calico employed in these experiments, stretched on a
wire frame and placed close together as a kind of pad, may
be taken to represent a dense acoustic cloud. Such a pad,
placed at the proper angle beyond N, cuts off the sound,
which in its absence reaches <i>f′</i>, to such an extent that the
flame <i>f′</i>, when not too sensitive, is thereby stilled, while <i>f</i> is
far more powerfully agitated than by the reflection from a
single layer. With the source of sound close at hand, the
echoes from such a pad would be of insensible duration.
Thus close at hand do I suppose the acoustic clouds surrounding
Villejuif to have been, a similar shortness of echo
being the consequence.</p>

<p>A further step is here taken in the illustration of the
analogy between light and sound. Our pad acts chiefly by
internal reflection. The sound from the reed is a composite
one, made up of partial sounds differing in pitch. If these
sounds be ejected from the pad in their pristine proportions,
the pad is acoustically <em>white</em>; if they return with their proportions
altered, the pad is acoustically <em>colored</em>.</p>

<p>
The following extract is taken from the “Life of Hooke,” which precedes
his “Posthumous Works,” published in 1705, by Richard Waller, Secretary
of the Royal Society: “In July the same year he (Dr. Hooke) showed a way
of making musical and other sounds by the striking of the teeth of several
brass wheels, proportionally cut as to their numbers, and turned very fast
round, in which it was observable that the equal or proportional strokes of
the teeth, that is, 2 to 1, 4 to 3, etc., made the musical notes, but the unequal
strokes of the teeth more answered the sound of the voice in speaking.”</p></div>

the slope by the impetus of the water and when the wave retreats the pebbles
are dragged down. Innumerable collisions thus ensue of irregular intensity
and recurrence. The union of these shocks impresses us as a kind of scream.

<p>The height of the note depends in some measure upon the size of the pebble,
varying from a kind of roar—heard when the stones are large—to a scream;
from a scream to a noise resembling that of frying bacon; and from this, when
the pebbles are so small as to approach the state of gravel, to a mere hiss.
The roar of the breaking wave itself is mainly due to the explosion of bladders
of air.</p></div>

large organs a lower octave is introduced, reaching to C<sup>11</sup>, with 16-1/2 vibrations.
But the musical character of all these tones under E is imperfect, because
they are near the limit where the power of the ear to unite the vibrations to
a tone ceases. In height the pianoforte reaches to a<sup>iv</sup>, with 3,520 vibrations,
or sometimes to c<sup>v</sup>, with 4,224 vibrations. The highest note of the orchestra

<p><a name="Footnote_35_35" id="Footnote_35_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35_35"><span class="label">35</span></a> The first experiment really made in the lecture was with a bar of steel
62 inches long, 1-1/2 inch wide, and 1/2 an inch thick, bent into the shape of a
tuning-fork, with its prongs 2 inches apart, and supported on a heavy stand.
The cord attached to it was 9 feet long and a quarter of an inch thick. The
prongs were thrown into vibration by striking them briskly with two pieces of
lead covered with pads and held one in each hand. The prongs vibrated transversely
to the cord. The vibrations produced by a single stroke were sufficient
to carry the cord through several of its subdivisions and back to a single ventral
segment. That is to say, by striking the prongs and causing the cord to
vibrate as a whole, it could, by relaxing the tension, be caused to divide into
two, three, or four vibrating segments; and then, by increasing the tension, to
pass back through four, three, and two divisions, to one, <em>without renewing the
agitation of the prongs</em>. The cord was of such a character that, instead of
oscillating to and fro in the same plane, each of its points described a circle.
The ventral segments, therefore, instead of being flat surfaces were surfaces of
revolution, and were equally well seen from all parts of the room. The tuning-forks
employed in the subsequent illustrations were prepared for me by that
excellent acoustic mechanician, König, of Paris, being such as are usually
employed in the projection of Lissajou’s experiments.</p></div>

various musical sounds can be obtained—some resembling those of a trumpet,

less intense effects are produced. When the two flames of a fish-tail burner
are permitted to impinge upon a plate of platinum, as in Scholl’s “perfectors,”
the sounds are trumpet-like, and very loud. Two ignited gas-jets may be caused
to flatten out like Savart’s water-jets. Or they may be caused to roll themselves
into two hollow horns, forming a most instructive example of the <em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wirbelflächen</em>

<p><a name="Footnote_65_65" id="Footnote_65_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_65_65"><span class="label">65</span></a> Sir John Herschel gives the following account of Arago’s observation:
“The rolling of thunder has been attributed to echoes among the clouds; and,
if it is considered that a cloud is a collection of particles of water, however
minute, in a liquid state, and therefore each individually capable of reflecting
sound, there is no reason why very large sounds should not be reverberated
confusedly (like bright lights) from a cloud. And that such is the case has
been ascertained by direct observation on the sound of cannon. Messrs. Arago,
Matthieu, and Prony, in their experiments on the velocity of sound, observed
that under a perfectly clear sky the explosions of their guns were always single
and sharp; whereas, when the sky was overcast, and even when a cloud came
in sight over any considerable part of the horizon, they were frequently accompanied
by a long-continued roll like thunder.”—“Essay on Sound,” par. 38.
The distant clouds would imply a long interval between sound and echo, but
nothing of the kind is reported.</p></div>

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
